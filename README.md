Peace means societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups.

"Psychological peace" (such as peaceful thinking and emotions) is less well-defined, yet perhaps a necessary precursor to establishing "behavioural peace". Peaceful behaviour sometimes results from a "peaceful inner disposition". Some[who?] have expressed the belief that peace can be initiated with certain inner qualitiesâ€”such as tranquility, forbearance, respect for others, compassion, self-control, courage, moderation, forgiveness, good temper, caution, and perspectiveâ€”that do not depend upon the uncertainties of daily life.[citation needed] The acquisition of such a peaceful internal disposition for oneself and others can contribute to resolving otherwise seemingly irreconcilable conflicts.

## History

In ancient times and more recently, peaceful alliances between different nations were codified through royal marriages. Two examples, Hermodike I (c.â€‰800 BCE)[5] and Hermodike II (c.â€‰600 BCE)[6] were Greek princesses from the house of Agamemnon who married kings from what is now Central Turkey. The union of Phrygia / Lydia with Aeolian Greeks resulted in regional peace, which facilitated the transfer of groundbreaking technological skills into Ancient Greece; respectively, the phonetic written script and the minting of coinage (to use a token currency, where the value is guaranteed by the state).[7] Both inventions were rapidly adopted by surrounding nations through further trade and cooperation.
