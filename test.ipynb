       "' \\n\\n \\n\\nCREATIVE ACCOUNTING\\n\\nto students, ‘use your intuition’, and then going off on a coffee break?\\n[However] sometimes you need to follow your instincts or inner rationale\\nalongside the critical thinking. Especially when you\\'r trying to distil or\\ncapture something that hasn\\'t yet been named or articulated. I have to\\nadmit that no matter how much I try to control my working process, there’s\\nalways that moment when pure improvisation/ inspiration takes hold.\\nMaybe that’s intuition.”\\n\\nPainter Merlin James also uses it when commenting on his making process, “It’s\\nintuitive. ..it’s to do with trying to get to unfamiliar territory.” This in turn chimes\\nwith Ryan Gander’s “place you don\\'t know”. For these artists the ‘intuitive’ comes\\ninto play only when the conditions are right, it works alongside (rather than\\ncompetes with) ‘critical thinking’ and, crucially, allows them to access the valued\\nterra incognita. In this way of thinking the artist displaces the art as the site of\\nknowledge. Theorist Estelle Barrett proposes “the valorisation of studio practice as\\na mode of enquiry””! and suggests, perhaps contentiously, that within a knowledge-\\nbased economy “the processes of enquiry and their potential for innovative\\napplication” may have greater value than the production of the works themselves.\\n77\\nNow, so far this may be very obvious. Artists enjoy the challenge of potential, and\\nthe pleasures of surprising themselves and so create spaces for not knowing, both\\nphysical and intellectual. But one reason I wish to demonstrate this through the\\nwords of artists is because current structures do not seem to allow for these spaces.\\nWithin education (at all levels) the prevailing culture requires one to be able to\\narticulate, at the point of experience, what one ‘knows’ (learning outcomes are a\\ngood example of this). This approach also prevails in our methods of accounting\\nfor art practices (funding bids, project proposals, etc.) where it appears faith has\\nbeen lost in the legitimacy of art practice as a mode of enquiry in itself. The\\nartist Sonia Boyce who at different times has a material, critical and relational art\\npractice has said:\\n\\nWhat I feel in conflict with now is the idea of having a pre-set programme\\nbefore I start. [In the 80s] there were expectations that one should go\\nforth with a clear agenda and plan and manage the work in relation to that\\nintention. I think that expectation came from the conceptual art of the 70s,\\nwhere one sets out a declaration of intent and then carries it out. It’s as if the\\nproposition is more important than how it’s made, as if you know what you\\'re\\ngoing to do before you do it... When I’m able to step back, I see that besides\\nthe things that I thought [my] work was about, there’s other things seeping\\nin. Now I don’t need to adhere to a declaration of intent; a right and a wrong.\\nInstead I say, “let’s just see what this is and how it unfolds”.??\\n\\nNOT KNOWING IN TALKING AND MAKING\\n\\x0c82\\n\\nON NOT KNOWING\\n\\nHOW ARTISTS THINK\\n\\n \\n\\nPhaophanit:... notion. And I, I believe also that how much you wandering\\naround and you film, part of your unconsciousness dictates...\\n\\nOboussier: Yes, that’s right, uh huh, absolutely\\n\\nPhaophanit:... somehow and, and that what dictates is, is from that\\nstrange familiarity notion. And then there is the making of it. During the\\nediting it is hard to bring this together, to find a new order in that sense.\\nBut funnily enough images find their own space, their own order. So it, it’s\\nvery intuitive somehow.”\\n\\nIn this section from early on in the recording, Phaophanit establishes his wish “to\\nfilm the state of things without too much interference” and throughout the rest of the\\nrecording he unpacks what he means by this. For example he goes on to explain that he\\nis not working to a “storyboard” and edits by grouping and juxtaposing printouts of film\\nclips in envelopes laid out on a table (taking us back to the simultaneity of the studio).\\nOboussier corroborates this by stating a number of times that the narrative of the film\\nhas not been “preconceived”. In the transcript his rejection of “interference” (I infer this\\nto mean an overtly constructed narrative) is achieved by his use of “the incidental” and a\\nbelief that his “unconscious” or “intuitive” sense will help guide his representation of the\\n“state of things”. In this he is forming an approach to his process, even what one might\\nterm a methodology, which might at first glance seem unlikely. Superficially at least,\\nwithin the history of art, a deliberate recourse to “unconsciousness” (to use Phaophanit’s\\nword) is more associated with the language of Surrealism than a desire to depict the\\n“state of things”. His use of the word intuitive is also finely judged. As with the other\\nartists mentioned above, Phaophanit\\'s confidence in an intuitive process is qualified —he\\nsuggests it is guided by what he terms the “strange familiarity notion”. Although he\\ndoesn\\'t say this explicitly during the recording my assumption is that here he is referring\\nto the ‘uncanny’ as explored by Freud. Freud defines the uncanny as the “hidden,\\nfamiliar thing that has undergone repression and then emerged from it”. In this context\\nthen a reliance on an inner, as yet unarticulated, guiding principle takes on a clearer\\nsense. He believes that over time, whilst reviewing the footage of Laos the important\\nor meaningful aspects of these sounds and images will make themselves known to him,\\nthrough a lengthy and revelatory editing process. He describes evaluating ten hours of\\nfilm footage as letting “the dust settle” or “digestion time”.\\n\\nIn another section Phaophanit explains why he has adopted this approach:\\nPhaophanit: I wanted to, to find a way, a completely new way of dealing\\n\\nwith the subject in that sense. I hope that there’s no feeling of nostalgia or,\\nor... do you see what I mean?\\n\\x0c \\n\\nPe Dien Ps core et non sce Fortnum\\n\\nTitre\\n\\n \\n\\x0c \\n\\nCREATIVE ACCOUNTING\\n\\nthem, so just as in the same way as I don’t want to separate form and content, the\\nJ y P\\nquestion doesn’t really make sense to me”.4\\n\\nAnswering the same question painter and writer Merlin James describes his\\nawareness when working, “[of] an interior, submerged monologue in the mind, but\\nit’s a commentary rather than prescriptive, and not much different from that which\\nmay be going on during other activities in life.”\\n\\nI am not equipped to speculate here about the ways in which artists (or even people\\nin general) move between their ‘submerged’ and more conscious deliberations but\\nit is clear that, both verbally and in written form, our current generation of artists\\nare providing words to accompany their work in ever increasing quantities. It seems\\nto me, if only from my own experience, that the events that require us to articulate\\nour intentions, methods, processes and possible achievements are both extremely\\nuseful and potentially destructive. Lectures, interviews, written statements, research\\nprojects, etc., are commonly feared by artists and one reason for this might be an\\nawareness of the impact they can have on their processes.\\n\\nLinda Sandino points out in her essay “Relating process: accounts of influence in 79\\nthe life history interview”, “By listening and responding to these narratives, we can\\nunravel the singular and complex ways in which artists’ identities are created and\\nre-created, and understand how artists’ stories of process are imbricated in the larger\\nproject of identity formation.”*\\n\\nAlthough there is a very real possibility that artists’ words may be less interesting\\nthan their artworks, I would suggest that how artists voice what, why and how they\\ndo what they do has a fundamental role in formulating what they continue to do.\\nIn the narratives formed around practices, in the stories artists tell, artists make\\nthemselves and begin to map their future production. This can work as affirmation,\\nencouraging the artist to develop an understanding of the kind of artist they believe\\nthemselves to be, as well as the work they have made. Yet equally forming identity,\\nmay also be seen as fixing identity, destroying the flow of the artist’s development.\\nArtists may feel unable or unwilling to talk, particularly about work in progress,\\nbecause they themselves do not yet know what it is they are making (as Boyce\\nexplained above). Indeed any articulation is destined to be a partial affair (in both\\nmeanings of the word) with the potential to ‘still born’ ideas and close off avenues.\\nWhen others are admitted into private processes, a defensiveness can emerge.\\nSandino again, “... for artists explanation and justification is the established practice\\nof artist’s public narratives, as enshrined in the Artist’s Statement, or manifesto\\nwhich then structures talk about work generally.”\\n\\nNOT KNOWING IN TALKING AND MAKING\\n\\x0c \\n\\nCREATIVE ACCOUNTING\\n\\n73\\n\\n \\n\\nStefan Roemer\\nStudio of John Baldessari\\n\\nLos Angeles, 2004 I\\'d now like to look briefly at the strategies an artist deploys to propel their work\\ntowards this unforeseen conclusion.\\n\\nTHE SPACES OF THE UNKNOWN\\n\\nThe characterisation of the studio as a “privileged space of imaginary freedom”\\nwhere artists indulge in “the fantasy of the creative self”\"’ is well established. In\\nhis seminal 1971 essay, “The function of the Studio”, Daniel Buren describes the\\ntraditional artist\\'s studio as an “ivory tower” and Buren’s critique finds a natural\\nheir in the relational work of the contemporary museum scene. The studio has\\nbecome theoretically indefensible; acting as a barrier between artist and audience\\nit exemplifies convention and tradition, insulating the artist from the world and\\nfeeding their natural solipsism. John Baldessari appears to reinforce this with his\\ncomment, “A studio is a sanctuary where the artist should be everyday as long as\\npossible... to do art one must choose self-imposed exile.”\\n\\nNOT KNOWING IN TALKING AND MAKING\\n\\x0c \\n\\nON NOT KNOWING\\n\\n \\n\\nHOW ARTISTS THINK\\n\\x0c74\\n\\nON NOT KNOWING\\n\\nHOW ARTISTS THINK\\n\\nWhilst it may remain a symbol of vocation and status as well as physical refuge, it\\nhas been hard to legislate against. As artist Gerard Byrne states:\\n\\nMy practice wouldn\\'t seem to imply the need for a studio in the conventional\\nunderstanding but somehow, out of a slightly guilt-ridden indulgence, I’ve\\nmanaged to develop a need for such a space.... What is important is that the\\nmythic image of ‘the studio’ as a /erra incognita is perpetuated. The mythic space\\nof the studio stands as a fortress for all artists, including those who don\\'t actually\\nhave a studio.\"\\n\\nClearly the status of the contemporary artist’s studio merits further discussion but\\nhere I would like to think about Byrne’s term “terra incognita”. It is not that Buren’s\\ntract has gone unheeded but imaginatively the lure of a studio as the space of\\ninfinite possibilities remains and it might be interesting to think about one reason\\nwhy this might be so.\\n\\nFor the artist with a material practice (and often for those without) the studio\\nis a site of flux and unforeseen events, a ‘living’ room, the container or arena for\\ncreative acts. Naturally contemporary art practice has tested this proposition to its\\nlimits. Bruce Nauman’s piece, Mapping the Studio I (Fat Chance John Cage) from\\n2001, continues his early insistence of the studio as a place that frames the art. This\\nvideo, a real time surveillance-quality film of his studio at night suggests, with an\\napparent flippancy that may wear thin over its 5 hour 45 minute duration, that it is\\nthe studio, rather than the artist, that defines the work. In positioning the physical\\nlimits of the studio as the work’s determining factor, Nauman displaces the artist at\\nthe centre of events and in doing so proposes a model of the creative process that\\nchallenges the ‘mythic’ archetypal image of frenzied artistic activity. His studio is\\ndull and monotonous, only fleetingly the site of action, when cat or mouse appear.\\nOf course, as the artist is not present to ‘make’ the film, the film quite literally enacts\\nthis drive in the making of an artwork, making that which is unknown to the artist\\navailable to him. Nauman describes Mapping the Studio I as “Mapping the leftover\\nparts and work areas of the last several years of other completed, unfinished, or\\ndiscarded projects.”\\n\\nHere the studio becomes a space that invites the unknown, a holding bay for process\\nthat staves off the work’s completion, maintaining it as a site of potential rather than\\na known quantity. Traditionally the artist inhabits the studio, filling it with the\\nphysical evidence of their time spent, leaving things in order to return. The studio\\nalso contains past work, sometimes stored, sometimes on view. It is often left to\\nserve as a prompt to the future, a key thought not yet explored sufficiently or it\\nmay get recycled, re~made as a new work; as Brian O’Doherty eloquently points\\n\\n \\n\\nan\\n\\x0c80\\n\\nON NOT KNOWING\\n\\nBeth Harland\\nMolecular 2\\n2010\\n\\noil on canvas\\n61 x 36cm\\n\\nHOW ARTISTS THINK\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPe sa) noel be :\\nee\\n\\nwet\\n\\n7\\n\\na\\nvr\\neee\\n3\\n\\nEEE ace ee.\\n\\nod\\naerate\\nTTB\\na)\\n\\nat\\n\\n&\\n\\nSandino goes on to note that this ‘established practice’, most apparent in formal\\nsituations, may often spill over into less formal ones. Indeed the distinction is\\noften blurred between a public interface and a more personal sphere that allows the\\nartist to voice to themselves the pressing questions, concerns and understandings\\nemerging from their work. Many of the quotations I have used throughout this\\nessay have a semi-public status, mostly recorded without an audience in an intimate\\nenvironment, they appear to range between the rehearsed and the spontaneous.\\nOccasionally the artist appears to be struggling to articulate a particular concern\\nfor the first time, other times they might re-iterate previously acknowledged\\nconclusions, perhaps with the purpose of hearing them, testing them for their\\ncontinued relevancy.\\n\\nOf course this linguistic formation of self, this “ideological becoming” to use\\nBahktin’s phrase, is evident in all discourse. Janet Maybin states, “For Volosinov and\\nBakhtin the heteroglossic and already spoken nature of language ensures that our\\nviews and understanding of the world, our relations with others and our sense of\\nour own identity are always evaluative and ideological.”®”\\n\\nWhat I am interested in here are the ways in which artists’ formal and informal\\nstatements are used in the creative process, allowing them access to self-knowledge,\\n\\x0c \\n\\nCREATIVE ACCOUNTING\\n\\n \\n\\n71\\n\\n \\n\\nNOT KNOWING IN TALKING AND MAKING\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nTHIS PAGE AND NEXT\\n\\nVong Phaophanit\\n\\nStill images from All that’s solid melts into air\\n(Karl Marx)\\n\\n2005\\n\\nText by Claire Oboussier\\n\\nCommissioned by The Quiet in The Land\\nTate Collection\\n\\n© Vong Phaophanit\\n\\nCREATIVE ACCOUNTING\\n\\ning and fro-ing between the known and the unknown and it is important to keep\\nmindful of their provisional nature.

Ginsborg describes a feeling of “helplessness before\\nthe object” as he makes and speculates, “It seems to me none of my work has a\\nforeseen conclusion to it.”®\\n\\nThe sculptor Alison Wilding also makes this clear when she voices her ambition\\nfor the work, “What I\\'m trying to do is to make a new thing which is increasingly\\nmore and more difficult. I sometimes wonder whether I’m simply repeating or re-\\nmaking the first object in [my different] streams of work.” She continues, “For me\\na good piece of work (something that either I have made or someone else has made)\\nis when the hair at the back of your neck stands on end when you encounter it...\\nThat’s what I demand from the things that I do....””\\n\\nWilding’s drive for a Eureka moment could be characterised in part as an echo of\\n\\nEzra Pound\\'s imperative, “make it new!” yet I believe the desire is quite complex and\\ncan be unpacked further. Another artist, Maria Chevska, responding to Wilding’s\\n\\nstatement counters:\\n\\nI\\'m really interested in that sort of epiphany type moment that you can have\\nwith a work that would give that visceral reaction... I would think they\\'re very\\nfew and far between but an artist continues to make work and I’m interested\\nin the sense of failure you could have by showing a body of work that you\\'ve\\nnot had that experience with.®\\n\\nAlthough Chevska’s comment marks her out as an artist rather more consciously\\ngrappling with what Rosalind Krauss terms the “working assumption” of originality\\nit is interesting to note that she too acknowledges a belief in the importance of this\\nmoment when the new is recognised manifest. Ryan Gander, another artist aware of\\nthe competing ideologies at play in the studio, reasons that pre-existing knowledge\\ncan lead to the lack of a creative challenge, reasoning, “If I make a work that is successful,\\nand I know how, then it’s no longer challenging. It has to take you to a place you don\\'t\\nknow, somewhere that scares you.”\\n\\nPerhaps, in addition to the twentieth century artist\\'s avant-garde impulse, one might\\nusefully discern a drive in the contemporary artist to make something that hovers\\non the edge of their own conceptions of the possible and probable. Painter Beth\\nHarland describes her approach, “I think moving towards something that is unknown\\nis important. Foucault calls it ‘working at the edge of an un-thought, slowly building\\n\\nx 910)\\n\\na language in which to think it’.\\n\\x0c \\n\\nON NOT KNOWING\\n\\nae\\nAas\\n\\n78\\n\\nSonia Boyce\\n\\nScat: Sound and Collaboration\\n\\n2013\\n\\nInstallation view, tniva at Rivington Place\\nCourtesy Thierry Bal and the artist\\n\\nHOW ARTISTS THINK\\n\\n \\n\\nBoyce uses the term “post-intentionality” to describe how the artist comes to an\\nunderstanding of, and an affirmation in, the work they have done.

He suggests this as a problematic notion, “The idea that non-language\\nbased art forms can become a ‘social phenomenon’ begs the question of how they\\ncross the language barrier without finding their four dimensional plasticity, mobility\\nor ephemerality enslaved within a realm of signs.”23\\n\\nWhen asked, “how much are non-visual matters or thoughts a part of your working\\nprocess?” Beth Harland replied, “For me making is thinking and I can’t separate\\n\\x0c \\n\\n© 2013 Black Dog Publishing and the authors.\\nAll rights reserved.\\n\\nBlack Dog Publishing\\n10A Acton Street\\nLondon\\n\\nWC1X 9NG\\n\\nt. +44 (0)207 713 5097\\n\\nf. +44 (0)207 713 8682\\nsales@blackdogonline.com\\nwww.blackdogonline.com\\n\\nOn Not Knowing: How artists think arises from a symposium of the same name,\\norganised by Rebecca Fortnum in collaboration with Elizabeth Fisher,\\nKettle’s Yard, 2009.\\n\\nwww.kettlesyard.co.uk\\n\\nPublished by Black Dog Publishing Ltd in association with Kettle’s Yard,\\nUniversity of Cambridge, and supported by University of the Arts London.\\n\\nAll opinions expressed within this publication are those\\nof the authors and not necessarily of the publisher.\\n\\nEdited by Elizabeth Fisher and Rebecca Fortnum\\nDesigned by Joo Mota and Leonardo Collina with the assistance of Giordano di Stasio\\nat Black Dog Publishing.\\n\\nBritish Library Cataloguing-in-Publication Data.\\nA CIP record for this book is available from the British Library.\\n\\nISBN 978 1 908966 29 2\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

It is very difficult I couldn\\'t\\ndeal in a very objective way, I am not a scientist, you just can’t deal... That\\nis why it is very complex. That is why I have to constantly question myself,\\nconstantly be suspicious of my feeling. ...*°\\n\\nHere Phaophanit seems to be making a case for his use of ‘intuition’ by\\n\\nsuggesting it is grounded in a disciplined approach. He appears to be using\\n\\nthe notion of the uncanny to bridge the gap between his individual experience\\n\\nand a sense of a poetic beyond, something of greater cultural significance. 83\\nThis is important because he is attempting to speak about other places and\\n\\nlives without disempowering them. His approach is thus not a surrender to\\nsubjectivity, rather his conversation makes it clear that he is struggling to\\n\\nmaintain the vigilant interrogation of his own motives and decisions. The\\n\\nprocess of letting the repressed emerge then is a deliberate stance and chimes\\n\\nwith his other values. For example at one point he says:\\n\\nI like the idea that the work starts with the silence to rest your mind and then\\nthings, ideas sort of come, start building up and questions start coming from\\nthat silence. But it is important, it is crucial for me to impose that silence\\nthrough the work. That is [also in] the installation work that I do or even\\nsmall objects, studio based type.*\"\\n\\nHe values what he terms ‘silence’, which operates both literally and metaphorically\\nin the work, because he considers it to have a role as a method of facilitating\\nquestions and ideas. In other words because he believes it allows both him and his\\naudience the chance to develop a thoughtful and critical response to what they see.\\nSilence for Phaophanit is synonymous with time, a pause that allows reflection, and\\nthis notion is extended to his own creative process, “... the editor wants the answers\\nstraight away and I just have to say I can’t deal with that now. It’s quite [a] healthy\\nway of doing the work by not rushing into it”.22\\n\\nNOT KNOWING IN TALKING AND MAKING\\n\\x0c \\n\\nON NOT KNOWING\\n\\n|\\n|\\n|\\n\\nase\\n\\nTHE PROCESSES OF THE UNKNOWN\\n\\n». The making process conjures challenges that the artist responds to. The artist’s\\nperception of their physical encounter with material is rarely characterised as an\\nadversarial one of mastery these days but artists often describe how the material\\nprocesses of making art unfold in unexpected ways. For example Borland continues,\\n“It’s not that I\\'m gathering information or data and then I go back into the studio\\nand make, the two things are much more interconnected and overlapping. It’s\\nalways important to me to be working with materials and often surprising things\\nmight happen that may throw me.”\\'®\\n\\nIt appears that, on occasion, when difficulties and doubts about suitable subject\\nmatter or procedures arise it feels as if the medium comes to the artist’s rescue.\\nRachel Lowe says, “Sometimes I don’t know what to do, often I will do something\\nphysically, like film something or use collage which will then lead onto an\\nunderstanding of what I’m trying to say through the work.””\\n\\nThe artist may ‘suspend’ their conscious deliberations, creating a sense for them that\\n\\n76 the medium has its own volition and that the work ‘talks back’ to them. As Paula\\nRego puts it, “The painting is a thing on its own, apart from you.... When I’ve\\nfinished, it’s telling me something.”\"®\\n\\nThis is interesting because it positions the artist as a continuing ‘learner’ and it is\\nthis that has perhaps led educationalist Mike Jarvis, echoing John Cewan, to term\\nthe artist “the quintessential reflective practitioner”. In his essay, “Articulating the\\ntacit dimension in artmaking”, Jarvis suggests that though the artist might feel that\\nthey are encountering the unknown, as I have already suggested, the use of this\\n‘wild card’ of ‘not knowing’ is often strategically employed. Using the painter Alex\\nKatz as his case study he suggests, “... the expertise of the procedure is located in\\nthe balance between the process of planning and intuitive action... it is precisely\\nbecause of the amount of preparation that Katz is able to make, that the final\\nperformance can be an intuitive and spontaneous exercise.”\\n\\nJarvis’ use of the word “intuitive” deserves some attention here as the term enjoys a\\nproblematic status within the vocabulary of contemporary visual art. The influence of the\\nnew art history has seen it outlawed in contemporary debate, equating it with uncritical,\\novertly personal practices. However in my conversations with artists I have been\\ninterested to see the word re-emerge, albeit in a qualified form. Artist Runa Islam says:\\n\\nI don’t ever use that word [intuition], maybe because it seems like a rude\\nword in art, at least in art school. Can you imagine art tutors saying\\n\\nHOW ARTISTS THINK\\n\\x0c84\\n\\nON NOT KNOWING\\n\\nHOW ARTISTS THINK\\n\\n \\n\\nPhaophanit explains that the curator who commissioned the work requires it to be\\nshown to both a Laotian and Manhattan audience. He responds to this potential\\nproblem saying, “In an ideal world one would say it’s just for one audience and\\nthat\\'s it.... For us it has never been an issue i.e. should we make the film for Laotion\\naudience or the international art world? We Just want to make the film and that’s\\nit. Because my position is that I always respect the viewer.”*?\\n\\nClearly Phaophanit has felt the need to find a strategy for making a work\\nthat will be acceptable to audiences with varied cultural capital. Here he\\nexemplifies the contrasting claims I discussed earlier; at the same time that he\\nis differentiating himself from others (his process will be ‘completely new’) his\\nmethod is forged on his belief in a collective sensibility. Later in the recording\\nOboussier crucially points out that Laos “is still a one party state and you\\ncannot say certain things that would be received in a critical way”.™ In this\\ncontext Phaophanit has been driven to find forms to witness his subject. He\\ntrusts his intuition to find a bridge across cultures, as a way of connecting\\nhimself to his audiences. His processes of making are guided by this ambition\\nfor a real human reverberation. He says:\\n\\nI always decided that the image and the sound should speak for\\nthemselves. This is to do with the way film documentation are made\\nusually, they don’t allow the people or the place to speak for themselves,\\nthere is always a voiceover, a narrative that almost put the, you know, put\\nthe seal on top everything. I felt that you know, this is the opposite...\\nthe viewer hears the sound or the silence as much as, in the same way as,\\nwhen I was there.\\n\\nAlthough it might appear that I am outlining a linear trajectory from the artist’s\\nbeliefs and sense of identity towards a set of aesthetic decisions this would\\noversimplify the situation, as the relationship can more properly be described as a\\ndynamic. Further, the sense of not knowing where the work may end up is crucial\\nto both the formation of the work and the artist’s sense of identity. In talking and in\\nmaking the artist comes to know, but that knowing is never complete, in the same\\nway that an artist’s work is never over.\\n\\nIn his 2013 TED talk, “Build a School in the Cloud” Sugata Mitra asks “is knowing\\nobsolete?”, proposing that in the future knowledge can be acquired at the point of\\nneed through what he terms “Self Organised Learning Environments”. What I am\\nsuggesting is that the processes of contemporary artists are demonstrations of such\\nenvironments and to create them artists knowingly use ‘not knowing’. In creative\\nprocesses, and the statements that emerge from them, there is a productive to-\\n\\x0c70\\n\\nON NOT KNOWING\\n\\nCREATIVE ACCOUNTING\\nNOT KNOWING IN TALKING\\nAND MAKING\\n\\nRebecca Fortnum\\n\\nOPPOSITE\\n\\nMichael Ginsborg\\n\\nFrom La Revue de L’Art no.9\\n2013\\n\\nInkjet prints, acrylic and paper\\non digital c-type print\\n\\n21.6 x 15.2cms\\n\\nHOW ARTISTS THINK\\n\\n \\n\\nArticulating what artists know is a crucial project for those involved in arts research\\nand education. Much important work has been done to redefine our understanding of\\nartistic knowledge, particularly in relation to practice-based PhD research, however\\nthis essay emerges from primary sources, using the words of artists to examine\\nmoments in art practice when artists negotiate their own knowledge. Specifically I\\nwill look at the role ‘not knowing’ plays within artists’ processes and statements. Most\\nof my observations are based on data I have collected during research projects with\\ncontemporary visual artists to document and reflect upon their creative processes.\\n\\nTHE QUEST TO KNOW\\n\\nWhen documenting how artists make, it is possible to identify certain general\\nstages, procedures and techniques in the creative process. However as T] Diffey\\npoints out it is difficult to pin down ‘how far’ they have got in their ‘understanding’.\\nHe explains the lack of an available predictive model for artistic endeavor, “To\\ncreate is to engage in undertakings the outcome of which cannot be known or\\ndefined or predicted, though there may be some presentiment of the outcome.”2\\n\\nFor virtually all artists, the search for the unknown outcome is not only welcome but\\nprovides a driving force within the creative process, as painter Paula Rego says “you\\nare doing it to find out what the result will be”.? Artists want to encounter, in their\\nfinal work, something that does not fée/ known to them. If an observer finds an artist’s\\noutcome entirely predictable, very often it has not been so for the artist making the work,\\n\\nHow artists achieve this desired ‘unknown outcome’ varies. As Michael Ginsborg\\n—an artist with a long-standing painting practice—reflects, it may involve\\ncareful orchestration:\\n\\nHow unforeseen is an unforeseen event? Where does the boundary of\\npossibility come? Having a technique to facilitate unforeseen events is a\\nclassic technique of modernist art. The facilitation of unforeseen discoveries\\nis what ran through the whole of the art of the last century, not all artists\\nof course, but unstable techniques, the absurd and the illogical are all about\\nthe unforeseen.’\\n\\x0c \\n\\nCREATIVE ACCOUNTING\\n\\ngaining insight into what they are doing. I would suggest that the statements artists\\nmake in relation to their work, even the prosaic descriptions of processes, are designed\\nto make their own values evident, often as much to themselves as others. Of course,\\nlike any self-analysis, this is a problematic enterprise, as Margaret Weatherall\\nputs it, “It is difficult when a person speaks to say what is personal and what is\\ncollective and cultural.””* This is a particularly interesting situation for the artist as\\ntraditional conceptions suggest a paradox in relation to this; the artist must be both\\nthe spokesperson for his/her cultural and historical moment yet also distinguished from it.\\n\\nI would like to conclude by examining an example of how a mature artist, in pursuit\\nof the ‘unknown’ resolution does so by demonstrating an extremely precise set of\\naesthetic decisions, and articulates these decisions in a way that helps define his\\nartistic identity.\\n\\nHOW ARTISTS COME TO KNOW: AN EXAMPLE\\n\\nVong Phaophanit is an artist with a distinguished career in installation, sculpture\\nand public artworks, who was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1993. The 81\\ndiscussion that I am examining (at which I am silently present) was recorded\\nbetween Vong and his partner/collaborator Claire Oboussier during the period they\\nworked together on his film A// that’s solid melts into air (Karl Marx) a work for the\\nQuiet in the Land, a prestigious international artists’ project based in Laos, that\\nwould also be premiered in New York and acquired by the Tate in 2008. Phaophanit\\nwas identified as the author of the film and Oboussier provided the spoken (and\\nsubtitled) texts, a ‘writer\\'s role’ she had taken in previous projects. In the recording\\nOboussier became the ‘prompt’, reflecting her statement that within their making\\nprocess she is often “the voice of Vong”.\\n\\nPhaophanit: One of the main approaches I had in mind was to film the state\\nof things without too much interference. So by recording the visual as well as\\nthe sound J like to reintroduce that in almost, you know, the entire project,\\nfilm project.\\n\\nOboussier: It is a wandering motion, kind of, erh, what’s the word? When\\nyou just...in French it is dérive, you know it’s this idea of just wandering and\\ncollecting as you go, without any predetermined intention.\\n\\nPhaophanit: The other thing is the incidental...\\n\\nOboussier: Yup\\n\\nNOT KNOWING IN TALKING AND MAKING\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nBruce Nauman\\nMapping The Studio I (Fat Chance John Cage)\\n2001\\n\\nDVD projections (color, sound, 5 hours 45 minutes)\\ndimensions variable\\n\\nDia Art Foundation; Partial Gift, Lannan\\nFoundation, 2013\\n\\n© 2013 Bruce Nauman / Artists Rights Society\\n(ARS), New York and DACS, London\\n\\nCREATIVE ACCOUNTING\\n\\nout “studio time is defined by [a] mobile cluster of tenses”.\"4 The studio ‘holds’\\nthe process non-sequentially. Evidence of initial explorations, unfocused desires,\\nmaterial experiments, blind alleys, slight asides as well as labours of love, moments\\nof sheer boredom and utter playfulness are simultaneously present. Artists will often\\ncollect objects and images not knowing why and ‘live’ with them for a while before\\nutilising them. Scottish artist Christine Borland says of her time as a student,\\n“T surrounded myself with a lot of stuff that I then began to use in the work.”’®\\n\\nOf course the accumulation of studio ‘stuff’ can act as a comforter to an artist,\\nconnecting her with the past, safe and known, but importantly it can also position\\nthe studio as a launch pad into the unknown by forcing the artist into visual and\\nmaterial encounters that, initially at least, may not be fully understood.\\n\\nNOT KNOWING IN TALKING AND MAKING\\n\\x0c'"

Founder/co-founder conflict is no joke. In fact, 65 per- cent of startups fail because of it. As in any relationship, poor communication is often the root of conflict between founders.

The content guy, who wasn’t Black, was, unbe- knownst to us, giving direction to the design team to use clichéd, out- dated slogans on the site like “Bet on Black.” We found out and I told him, “Phrases like that are very clichéd in our community.” He then proceeded to inform me, a Black woman and his client, that I was very clearly wrong. He was promptly relieved of his duties.\n",

    "Hiring a team member is a two-way relationship. It’s not just about a good fit for you, but also a good fit for the potential employee as well. My advice is, if you can, before bringing anyone onto the team officially, test the relationship first by hiring them as a consultant with a mutually agreed upon time limit (usually no more than three months) paid at the monthly equivalent of the job at the full-time rate.* This is a great way to see if they are a match for you and if you're a match for them.

    "CHAPTER 1The Art of Starting UpThe most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one thatheralds new discoveries, is not “Eureka!” (I found it!)but “That’s funny . . .”—Isaac AsimovGIST (Great Ideas for StartingThings)It’s much easier to do things right from the start than to fixthem later. At this stage, you are forming the DNA of yourstartup, and this genetic code is permanent. By payingattention to a few important issues, you can build the rightfoundation and free yourself to concentrate on the bigchallenges. This chapter explains how to start a startup.Answer Simple QuestionsThere is a myth that successful companies begin withgrandiose ambitions. The implication is that entrepreneursshould start with megalomaniacal goals in order to succeed. Tothe contrary, my observation is that great companies began byasking simple questions\n",
    ", WHAT?* This question arises whenyou spot or predict a trend and wonder about itsconsequences. It works like this: “Everyonewill have a smartphone with a camera andInternet access.” Therefore, what? “They willbe able to take pictures and share them.”Therefore, what? “We should create an app thatlets people upload their photos, rate the photosof others, and post comments.” And, voila,there’s Instagram.ISN’T THIS INTERESTING? Intellectual curiosityand accidental discovery power this method.Spencer Silver was trying to make glue butcreated a substance that barely holds papertogether. This oddity led to Post-it Notes. RayKroc was an appliance salesman who noticedthat a small restaurant in the middle of nowhereordered eight mixers. He visited the restaurantout of curiosity, and it impressed him with itssuccess. He pitched the idea of similarrestaurants to Dick and Mac McDonald, and therest is history. IS THERE A BETTER WAY? Frustration with thecurrent state of the art is the hallmark of thispath. Ferdinand Porsche once said, “In thebeginning I looked around and, not finding theautomobile of my dreams, decided to build itmyself.”* Steve Wozniak built the Apple Ibecause he believed there was a better way toaccess computers than having to work for thegovernment, a university, or a large company.Larry Page and Sergey Brin thought measuringinbound links was a better way to prioritizesearch results and started Google.WHY DOESN’T OUR COMPANY DO THIS?Frustration with your current employer is thecatalyzing force in this case. You’re familiarwith the customers in a market and their needs.You tell your management that the companyshould create a product because customers needit, but management doesn’t listen to you.Finally, you give up and do it yourself.IT’S POSSIBLE, SO WHY DON’T WE MAKE IT?Markets for big innovations are seldom provenin advance, so a what-the-hell attitudecharacterizes this path. For example, back inthe 1970s a portable phone wasincomprehensible to most people whenMotorola invented it. At the time, phones werelinked to places, not people. However, MartinCooper and the engineers at Motorola wentahead and made it, and the rest is history. Don’tlet anyone tell you that the “If we build it, theywill come” theory doesn’t work.“The genesis of great companies is answering simplequestions that change the world, not the desire tobecome rich.”WHERE IS THE MARKET LEADER WEAK? Threeconditions make a market leader vulnerable\n",
    ", when the leader is committed to a way ofdoing business. For example, IBM distributedcomputers through resellers, so Dell couldinnovate by selling direct. Second, when thecustomers of the leader are dissatisfied. Forexample, the necessity to drive to Blockbusterstores to pick up and return videos opened thedoor for Netflix. Third, when the market leaderis milking a cash cow and stops innovating.This is what made Microsoft Office susceptibleto Google Docs.“How can we make a boatload of money?” is not one ofthe questions. Call me idealistic, but the genesis of greatcompanies is answering simple questions that change theworld, not the desire to become rich.EXERCISEComplete this sentence: If your startup neverexisted, the world would be worse off because__________.Find Your Sweet SpotIf you have the answer to a simple question, the next step is tofind a viable sweet spot in the market. Mark Coopersmith,coauthor of The Other “F” Word: Failure—Wise Lessons forBreakthrough Innovation and Growth, and senior fellow at theHaas School of Business, helps entrepreneurs do this by usinga Venn diagram with three factors\n",
    ". This is the sum total of what youand your founders can do. Though you won’tyet have a complete team, you must have a coreof fundamental knowledge and ability to createsomething in order for a startup to start up.OPPORTUNITY. There are two kinds ofopportunities: an existing market and apotential one. Either is okay, but do a realitycheck of the size of the market in the next fewyears. There’s a reason people rob banks, notthrift stores. There are times, however, whenthere’s no way to prove that an opportunityexists and you just have to believe.PASSION. This one is tricky because it’s notclear whether passion causes success or successcauses passion. Everyone assumes the former istrue, but let’s be honest: it’s easy to get excitedabout a business that takes off, so the latter maybe true too. Still, success may take a long time,so you’d better at least not hate what you’redoing. Don’t get the impression that all three factors arenecessary or even obvious at the start. If you have at least twoof the factors, you can often develop the third if you try hardenough.Find Soul MatesThe next step is to find some soul mates to go on youradventure—think Bilbo Baggins in The Fellowship of theRing. However, people love the notion of the sole innovator\n",
    "Edison (lightbulb), Steve Jobs (Macintosh), HenryFord (Model T), Anita Roddick (The Body Shop), and RichardBranson (Virgin Airlines). It’s wrong.Successful companies are usually started, and becomesuccessful, with the contributions of at least two soul mates.After the fact, people may recognize one founder as theinnovator, but it takes a team to make a new venture work.“The first follower is what transforms the lone nut intoa leader.”To illustrate this concept, Derek Sivers, the founder ofCD Baby, showed a video at the TED2010 conference thatstarts with one person dancing alone in a field. A secondperson joins in, and then a third, and the crowd “tips” into afull-scale dance festival. According to Sivers, the first follower plays an importantrole because he brings credibility to the leader. Subsequentfollowers emulate the first follower, not only the leader. In hiswords, “The first follower is what transforms the lone nut intoa leader,” and in a startup, that first follower is usually acofounder.Cofounding soul mates need to have both similarities anddifferences. The key desirable similarities are\n",
    ". Although this has become an overusedword uttered by wannabe visionaries, in thecontext of soul mates, it means that foundersshare a similar intuition for how the startup andmarket will evolve. For example, if one founderbelieves that computers will remain a businesstool for large organizations, and the otherbelieves the future is small, cheap, and easy-to-use personal computers for everyone, theyaren’t a good match.SIZE. Not everyone wants to build an empire.Not everyone wants a lifestyle business. Therearen’t right and wrong expectations; there areonly expectations that match or don’t match.This doesn’t mean founders can know whatthey want at the start, but it’s nice if they’re atleast on the same page.COMMITMENT. Founders should share the samelevel of commitment. Does the startup, family,or a balanced life come first? It’s hard to makea startup work when the founders have differentpriorities. One founder wanting to work for twoyears and flipping the startup for a quick saleand the other wanting to create a company thatwill endure for decades will create problems.Ideally, founders agree that they’re in it for atleast ten years.The differences that are desirable include\n",
    ". At a minimum, a startup needs atleast one person to make the product (SteveWozniak) and one person to sell it (Steve Jobs).Founders need to complement each other tobuild a great organization.ORIENTATION. Some people like to sweat thedetails. Others like to ignore the details andworry about the big issues. A successful startupneeds both types of founders to succeed.PERSPECTIVE. The more perspectives, themerrier. These can include young versus old,rich versus poor, male versus female, urbanversus country, engineering versus sales, techieversus touchy, Muslim versus Christian, andstraight versus gay.Finally, a few words of wisdom about cofounders\n",
    "NOT RUSH. Founders may have to worktogether for decades, so add them like youwould pick a spouse—assuming you’re not aserial divorcee. It’s better to have too fewfounders than too many. Breaking up withfounders, like spouses, is hard to do.DO NOT ADD FOUNDERS TO ENHANCEFUNDABILITY. The reason to bring in additionalfounders—and any other employee butespecially founders—is to make your startupstronger and more likely to succeed. Askyourself, “Would I hire this guy if we didn’tneed funding?” If your answer is no, you’d beinsane to hire him.ASSUME THE BEST, BUT PLAN FOR THE WORST.Founding teams blow up all the time. Yourstartup may be the exception, but just in case,make everyone (including yourself) vest hisstock over time to prevent people who leave inless than four years from owning large amountsof equity.Make MeaningNow take your answer to the simple question, sweet spot, andsoul mates and assume that you do succeed. Then subjectyourself to one more test: Does your startup make meaning?Meaning is not money, power, or prestige. Meaning is notcreating a cool place to work with free food, Ping-Pong,volleyball, and dogs. Meaning is making the world a betterplace.“If you make meaning, you’ll probably also makemoney.”This is a difficult question to answer when you’re twoguys/gals in a garage who are writing software or hand-making gizmos, but it’s also difficult to comprehend how anacorn can grow into an oak tree. If, in your wildest dreams,you cannot imagine that your startup will make the world abetter place, then maybe you’re not starting a tilt-the-earthcompany.This is okay; there aren’t many companies that tilt theearth. And there are even fewer in that category that set out todo so. But WTF, I want you to dream big. When today’shumongous companies were only one year old, few peoplepredicted their ultimate success or the meaning they wouldmake. Trust me, if you make meaning, you’ll probably alsomake money.Make MantraThe next step is to create a three- to four-word mantra thatexplains the meaning that your startup is seeking to make. Forstartups, the definition of “mantra” from the AmericanHeritage Dictionary of the English Language is perfect\n",
    "sacred verbal formula repeated in prayer,meditation, or incantation, such as an invocation ofa god, a magic spell, or a syllable or portion ofscripture containing mystical potentialities.Here are five examples (some hypothetical) that illustratethe power of a good mantra to communicate the meaning oforganizations\n",
    "athletic performance (Nike)*Fun family entertainment (Disney)Rewarding everyday moments (Starbucks)Democratize commerce (eBay)Empower craftspeople (Etsy)These examples illustrate the three most importantcharacteristics of a mantra\n",
    ". Mantras are short, sweet, andmemorable. (The shortest mantra is the singleHindi word “Om.”) Mission statements arelong, dull, and forgettable. From the CEO to thereceptionist, everyone must know it. Comparethe effectiveness of Starbucks’s mantra,“Rewarding everyday moments,” to its missionstatement, “Establish Starbucks as the premierpurveyor of the finest coffee in the world whilemaintaining our uncompromising principleswhile we grow.” I rest my case.“‘Authentic athletic performance’ is much better than‘Sell lots of shoes made in China.’”POSITIVITY. Mantras are uplifting and explainhow your startup does good things that makethe world a better place. “Authentic athleticperformance” is much better than “Sell lots ofshoes made in China.”OUTWARD FOCUS. Mantras express what you dofor customers and society. They are not selfishand self-serving. “Get rich” is the antithesis of amantra. Customers want you to “democratizecommerce,” but they don’t care about makingyou and your shareholders rich.EXERCISEWrite your startup’s mantra in this space:___________________EXERCISEThink about how you serve your customers.What kind of meaning does your startupmake?EXERCISEIf someone asks your parents or yourreceptionist what your startup does, whatwould they say?Pick a Business ModelYou’re likely to change your business model several times, soyou don’t have to make the right decision at the beginning.However, starting a discussion of this topic is importantbecause it puts everyone in a moneymaking mind-set. Allemployees should understand that a startup either makesmoney or dies.A good business model forces you to answer twoquestions\n",
    "has your money in their pockets?How are you going to get it into your pocket?These questions may lack subtlety, but making money isn’t asubtle process. More elegantly stated, the first questioninvolves identifying your customer and the need that she feels.The second question creates a sales mechanism to ensure thatyour revenues exceed your costs.The best list of business models that I’ve found is in abook called The Art of Profitability by Adrian Slywotzky. Hereare my favorites from his book\n",
    "SOLUTION. This involves a deepdive into customers’ problems and doing whatit takes to make them happy. Over time astartup can add deep relationships with otherentities to reach significant total sales, but eachnew customer involves hand-to-hand combat.(Slywotzsky calls this the customer solution.)MULTICOMPONENT. Coca-Cola embodies thismodel, according to Slywotzsky. Coca-Colasells in supermarkets, convenience stores,restaurants, and vending machines. The sameproduct is sold in different business settings andat different prices per ounce.MARKET LEADER. Apple embodies the market-leader business model.

Thomas Moser furniture is anexample of the craftsman business model. Thisis the kind of startup that places the highestpriority on quality and craftsmanship. It maynever get large, but it’s the finest in itssector . . . although with a marketplace likeEtsy, you never know.You’ll tweak your business model constantly—in fact, it’sscary if you don’t change your model or do some majortweaking along the way. Here are some additional tips to helpyou during the process\n",
    "A SPECIFIC NICHE. The more preciselyyou can describe your customer, the better.Many entrepreneurs are afraid of too narrowand specific a focus because it won’t lead toworldwide dominance. However, mostsuccessful companies started off targeting amarket or two and growing (oftenunexpectedly) to a large size by addressingother markets.KEEP IT SIMPLE. If you can’t describe yourbusiness model in ten words or fewer, you don’thave a business model. Avoid whateverbusiness jargon is hip (strategic, mission-critical, world-class, synergistic, first-mover,scalable, enterprise-class, etc.). Businesslanguage does not make a business model.Think of eBay’s business model: charge alisting fee plus a commission. End ofdiscussion.COPY OTHERS. Commerce has been around along time, so by now people have pretty muchinvented every possible business model. Youcan innovate in technology, marketing, anddistribution, but attempting to come up with anew business model is a lousy bet. Try to relateyour business model to one that’s alreadysuccessful and understood. You have plenty ofother battles to fight.EXPANSIVE. Business models involving creatinga bigger pie rather than grabbing more of thesame pie work better for startups. This isbecause customers expect to discover productsthat are innovative and cool and are lessinterested in me-too, better sameness fromstartups.EXERCISESTEP 1: Calculate the monthly costs ofoperating your organization.STEP 2: Calculate the gross profit of each unit ofyour product.STEP 3: Divide the results of step 1 by theresults of step 2.Weave a MATT (Milestones, Assumptions,Tests, Tasks)A mat is “a heavy woven net of rope or wire cable placed overa blasting site to keep debris from scattering,” according to theAmerican Heritage Dictionary of the English Language.Preventing scattering is what’s necessary for startups becauseentrepreneurs need to do many things at once. To stay incontrol, you need to weave a MATT, which stands formilestones, assumptions, tests, and tasks.• MILESTONES. Accomplishing a large number of goals is anecessary objective for every startup. However, some goalsstand above the others because they mark significant progressalong the road to success. The five most important milestonesare\n",
    "prototypeInitial capitalField-testable versionPaying customerCash-flow breakevenThere are other factors that affect the survival of theorganization, but none are as important as these milestones.Their timing will drive the timing of just about everythingelse, so you should spend 80 percent of your effort on them.• ASSUMPTIONS. This is a list of the typical majorassumptions that you might make about your business\n",
    "sizeGross marginSales calls per salespersonCost of customer acquisitionConversion rate of prospects to customersLength of sales cycleReturn on investment for the customerTechnical support calls per unit shippedPayment cycle for receivables and payablesDiscussing and documenting these assumptions at anearly stage is important because they are a reality check on theviability of a startup. For example, assuming that the length ofthe sales cycle is four weeks and finding out that it’s a yearwill cause cash-flow problems.• TESTS. You can come up with a solid list of assumptions,but everything is theoretical until you start testing them\n",
    "the customer-acquisition cost permitprofitable operation?Will people use your product?Can you afford to support them?Can the product withstand real-world use?• TASKS. Finally, there are tasks that are necessary to reachmilestones and test assumptions. Any activities that don’tcontribute to achieving them are not crucial and are lowpriority. Essential tasks include\n",
    "employeesFinding vendorsSetting up accounting and payroll systemsFiling legal documentsThe point of the list of tasks is to understand andappreciate the totality of what your startup has to accomplishand prevent important items from slipping through the cracksin the early, often euphoric, days.Once you have your MATT, the next steps are tocommunicate it to the entire company, make revisions, beginimplementation, and monitor results. Of all things, yourMATT is not something to create and never refer to again. It isthe epitome of a document to put to work and to alter.Keep Things Clean and SimpleYou will face hundreds of decisions during the startup process,and there’s often a temptation to optimize each one of them—sometimes by breaking new ground. However, it’s best tofocus your energy and attention on milestone issues. Foreverything else, go with the flow and stick to your MATT bykeeping things clean and simple. My experience and expertiseis with U.S. companies, but these are generally acceptedentrepreneurial practices:“In the United States, if your goal is to create the nextGoogle, you want to form a Delaware C corporation.”• CORPORATE STRUCTURE. Every country has differentcommercial entities, such as corporations, partnerships,limited-liability corporations, and cooperatives. You want acorporate structure with three characteristics: one that isfamiliar, if not comfortable, for investors; sellable to othercompanies or on the public stock market; and capable ofoffering financial incentives to employees.In the United States, if your goal is to create the nextGoogle, you want to form a Delaware C corporation. This is aseparate tax-paying entity that can accept outside investmentand can issue multiple classes of stock. Owners are notpersonally responsible for debts and liabilities, and losses arenot passed through to owners.If your goal is to create a small business that isn’t goingto seek venture capital and you don’t aspire to go public, thenconsider an S corporation, limited-liability corporation, or soleproprietorship.• INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. A startup shouldunequivocally own or unequivocally have licensed itsintellectual property. This means that there are no lawsuits, orany risk of lawsuits, by former employers and no charges thatthe intellectual property infringes on someone’s patents.Also, the intellectual property and licenses should belongto the startup, not the founders. This is because you never wanta situation where a disgruntled founder leaves the startup andtakes the intellectual property with him—crippling the startup.• CAPITAL STRUCTURE. This refers to the ownership of thestartup. There are four warning signs; they all belong to the If-I-Knew-Then-What-I-Know-Now-Hall of Fame\n",
    "few founders own the vast majority of thestartup, and they are not willing to extendownership to other employees.A small group of investors that doesn’t wantdilution of ownership has dominant control ofthe company.Dozens of small investors make managingshareholders a burdensome and slow task.Overpriced previous rounds of financing makean investment unattractive to new investors.• EMPLOYEE BACKGROUND. Areas of concern includeexecutives who are married to each other and executives whoare related to one another; unqualified friends in high-levelpositions; and high-level employees with criminal convictions.These issues may signal that the startup isn’t a meritocracy.• REGULATORY COMPLIANCE. This refers to issues withstate or federal laws and regulations, nonpayment of taxes, andsolicitations of unqualified investors. Typically issues withregulatory compliance indicate clueless or crookedmanagement—both are unacceptable and will hinder progress.Experts have written entire books about these five topics,so don’t make decisions based on my brief explanation of suchcomplex issues. These are areas where you only need to learnthat you don’t know what to do, so that you can find an expertwho does.Do Something CringeworthyIf you are not embarrassed by the first version ofyour product, you’ve launched too late.—Reid HoffmanWhen I go back and read the first book I wrote, The MacintoshWay, I cringe at its crudeness. When I remember the firstMacintosh, I cringe because it didn’t have enough software,RAM, or storage, and it was slow. When you look back at thefirst version of your product, you might cringe too.It’s okay. It happens to everyone. The first version of aproduct is always flawed, but how it evolves is as important ashow it begins. The fortunate startups are the ones who are stillaround because they eventually got the product and businessmodel right, so give yourself a break.AddendaMinichapter: How to Separate Contenders fromPretendersOnce upon a time there were two engineering PhDs who wereclueless about how to start a company. All they knew how todo was code. They were so desperate for money and adultsupervision that when an experienced businessperson showedinterest and offered to help raise money, they, in their ownwords, “followed him like dogs.”However, this adult didn’t know much about tech startupsand caused them to make many mistakes in legal and financialmatters. They parted ways but only after much aggravationand the significant legal expense of reversing incorrectdecisions.“There are many experienced, successful, and savvybusiness executives who don’t understand theparticulars of startups and venture capital.”This is not an unusual story, and it’s an understandableone. First-time entrepreneurs are looking for any particle ofpositive feedback, reinforcement, and advice, so they jump atthe first sign of interest. The demand for adult supervision inthe form of advisers, board members, and investors farexceeds the supply, so you may need to take a chance withpeople who are untested in these roles. If no one will dancewith you, the temptation is to dance with the first person whoasks.People who started their own company or worked at acompany before an IPO can probably provide good advice.People who have not started a company or joined a companyafter it went public probably cannot. Experienced, successful,and savvy business executives at large companies don’tnecessarily understand the particulars of startups and venturecapital.For example, how much do you think a senior vicepresident of Microsoft who came from McKinsey knows aboutstarting a company? Here is an EQ (entrepreneur’s quotient)test to separate the contenders from the pretenders. Thesequestions will help you identify good advisers, boardmembers, and investors (if you have the luxury of choosinginvestors).1. What kind of corporation should we form? Answeryou’re looking for: “C corporation,” assuming thegoal is to create the next Google.2. In what state should we incorporate? Answer you’relooking for: “Delaware.”3. Do our investors have to be accredited investors?Answer you’re looking for: “Yes.” Answer thatshould scare you: “No.”4. Should two founders split the company right downthe middle? Answer you’re looking for: “No, youshould allocate 25 percent to future employees and35 percent to the first two rounds of investments.That leaves 40 percent for the founders to splitamong themselves.”5. Should we sell common or preferred stock toinvestors? Answer you’re looking for: “Preferred.”6. Should all employees, including founders, gothrough a vesting process? Answer you’re lookingfor: “Yes, everyone should vest because you don’twant a founder to leave with a significant percentageof the company after a few months.”7. Should we pay consultants with stock options?Answer you’re looking for: “No, stock options arefor long-term employees, not short-term consultants.If you can’t afford consultants, do the workyourself.”8. Can we get a bank loan to start our business?Answer you’re looking for: “No,” assuming it’s atech business. Tech businesses don’t have liquidassets to use as collateral.9. Should we use an investment bank, broker, or finderto raise seed capital? Answer you’re looking for:“No, angel and venture capital investors view early-stage entrepreneurs who use a banker, broker, orfinder as clueless.”10. What do we need our revenue projections to look likein five years to attract investors? Answer you’relooking for: “No investor will believe them anyway,but they should be as good as the closest comparablesuccessful company that has already gone public.”Also, you don’t want money from investors who dobelieve your projections, because they are clueless.11. How long should our business plan be? Answeryou’re looking for: “You shouldn’t write a businessplan. You should get customers.”12. Is there someone else you would also recommendwho could be a good adviser? Answer you’relooking for: “Sure, my expertise is narrow, but letme come up with a list of other possibilities.”Answer you’re not looking for: “No, you don’t needanyone else; I know everything you need to know.”13. Do you think we need a real CEO? Answer you’relooking for: “Maybe, someday. But probably notright now. What you really need right now is a greatproduct.”14. Should we use a headhunter to recruit people?Answer you’re looking for: “No, at this stage, youdon’t have the money and can’t afford to spend whatlittle you have on headhunting fees.”15. What should we tell investors when they ask us forthe valuation of the company? Answer you’relooking for: “Find out what three or four investorsthink is fair, and then get more market traction topush it up.” Wrong answers: “Price it high andnegotiate down,” “Price it low and negotiate up.”16. What do you think the KPIs are for our business?Answer you’re looking for: dependent on yoursector and type of business. Answer you’re notlooking for: “What’s a KPI?”17. How do I build buzz? Answer you’re looking for:“Build something great and use social media.”18. How big should our advertising budget be? Answeryou’re looking for: “Zero dollars—use social mediainstead.”Again, these questions are relevant to U.S. companieswith Google-esque ambitions, but the same kinds of questionsapply in other circumstances. Run away from anyone whowants to advise you who can’t answer most of these questions.FAQ (Frequently Avoided Questions)Q: I admit it: I’m scared. I can’t afford to quit my current job. Isthis a sign that I don’t have what it takes to succeed?A: It doesn’t mean anything. You should be scared. Ifyou aren’t scared, something is wrong with you,and your fears are not a sign that you don’t have theright stuff. In the beginning, every entrepreneur isscared. It’s just that some deceive themselves aboutit, and others don’t.You can overcome these fears in two ways.First, the kamikaze method is to dive into thebusiness and try to make a little progress every day.One day you’ll wake up and you won’t be afraidanymore—or at least you’ll have a whole new setof fears.Second, you could start by working on yourproduct at night and on weekends and duringvacations. Make as much progress as you can, try toget some proof of your concept, and then take theleap. Ask yourself what’s the worst thing that couldhappen. It’s probably not too bad.Q: Should I share my secret ideas with anybody other than mydog?A: The only thing worse than a paranoid entrepreneuris a paranoid entrepreneur who talks to his dog.There is much more to gain—feedback,connections, sales opportunities—by discussingyour idea with many people than there is to lose.Also, if discussing your idea makes itindefensible, you don’t have much of an idea in thefirst place. Ideas are easy; implementation is hard.My hypothesis is that the more an entrepreneurinsists on a nondisclosure agreement, the less viablethe idea. After several decades of work withstartups in Silicon Valley, I’ve never heard of acompany stealing an idea and implementing it well.Q: How far along should I be before I start talking to peopleabout what I’m doing?A: Start right away. By doing so you’ll be constantlymulling over your idea—as both a foreground andbackground task. The more people you talk to, thericher your thoughts will be. If it’s only you staringat your navel, all you’ll see is lint building up.Q: I think that I have a great idea, but I don’t have a businessbackground. What should I do now?A: If all you’ve done is come up with a great idea—forexample, “a new computer operating system that’sfast, elegant, and bug free”—but you can’timplement it, then you have nothing. This is whyyou need a cofounder—until you’ve convincedother people about your idea, you may be a nutcase.Q: When should I worry about looking like a real business, withbusiness cards, letterhead, and an office?A: Your priorities are wrong. What you should worryabout is a working prototype. A real business is onewith something to sell—not one where people havebusiness cards and letterhead.Q: Do I need an MBA to start a company?A: Not at all—and I have an MBA. You need an MBAto fulfill the expectations of an employer. In thecase of a startup, you are the employer. It’s better tospend two years in the trenches getting the shiitakekicked out of you than mastering businessadministration.Recommended ReadingBerger, Warren.

整個團體班其實就一直在下降 這是我自己的一個見解 所以說 我是因為團班的獲利 我覺得下降了 那既然下降的話 那就要想到一個 可以突破的方法 所以我就把它變成小班制 然後就在做個別指導 我自己的這個 轉型做個別指導 原因 我覺得是這樣的過程 那當然還有一個是 我自己公司的一個核心價值 就是要做那個精緻化的 精緻化的 這是精緻化的教學 這個大概從我 一開始創業的時候 即使我是做團班 我也是都是要強調我是精緻化教學 那如果我的精緻化 就我要去區隔我跟 其他團體班的不同 那就是我有 很多的這個輔助的老師 在我以前做團班的時候 我是這樣子 那除了姐弟跟輔導 那除了姐弟跟輔導以外 我有時候會在上課的過程當中 我就直接分組 所以那個雛型 已經具備了 以前我在上團體班的時候 假設我以前團體班的老師 都上三個小時 那我可能上到一個多小時後 來這邊 我就開始分組 因為一個班畢竟還有一百多人 所以有時候分組下 就分個七八組 那這本來就是我以前在 上課方式的一個 所以我自己是覺得 我認為團班根本 要轉型做個別指導 一定就是覺得 講做不下去是有點誇張 不見得到做不下去 但事實上就是覺得不行 或者我們已經有一點看到未來了 因為我訪問的當然都是 很早的接觸到個別指導 其實您是最早的 基本上比較不像現在才要做的人 的心態 所以我把題目會訂成這樣 不過我理解 在我的角度 想說這個題目我們可以 我覺得一定也是有人獲利不錯的時候 覺得要轉做個別指導 因為他就是像你剛才講的 看到未來我覺得 要去做這樣的一個調整 那我是 我自己在看 你這些題目 讓我要回想很多 十幾年 二十年前的事情 可是我想一想發現好像是這樣子 不過那個很特別 團班變成很多組 然後每組來實戰演練 可能我一個半小時來教 一個半小時來做題目 其實這個對學生效果 我覺得有時候更棒 當然我那時候這種做法 一定也是在當時 因為我就是要精緻化 第二個我要差異化 這兩個 這一直是我的 核心價值 所以說我現在要怎麼樣去做 差異化跟精緻化 那時候也沒有特別想到 個別指導這幾個字 可是他已經有一種 精神已經存在 所以後來接觸就順勢而為 不過我覺得獨特性跟差異化 的確很特別在那個時候能做到這樣 我覺得這個應該很少人會這樣做 我沒聽過耶 我沒聽過有人這樣做耶 我自己有類似啦 可是還沒有分到這麼多組 我可能只有兩三個主講 那每個人可能要管那個最爛的那四五個 那強的我就自己發 我那時候是這樣做 所以你也是有這樣的過程 有 那個就是太弱的 沒辦法接團班 到後來我記得我那時候一個班教五六十人 其實五六十人也是很難教 因為學生的那個程度 層層不齊整 而且已經不可能像我們以前建北班 或整個班 都前三志願了 那根本招不起來 沒有辦法招到這樣的班級 除非 其實你可以分這麼多組 你在分的時候是不是就有分級 假設七八組是這樣 還是其實是有強弱帶在一起 因為什麼 同學還是喜歡在一起 這可能這一百多個主持人當中 可能那一票 七八個我們就是同班同學 我們就是我一把他拆散 他們也五十班本來就這樣 我們也是希望學生喜歡啦 那你會教強的教弱的嗎 在那個組別 討論過程當中 我不會特別這樣講 但強的自然就會自發表 那我們就是有一個 助理老師在旁邊看著 其實我也覺得 台灣如果說沒有導入 個別之道的話 有可能未來還是會走到這個地步 只是說因為 因為康軒還有日本拓仁 還有冠傑的關係 好像把這個時程 給提早了 我覺得是提早退讓 要不然如果照我們現在台灣 整個歷史發展下來 應該最後也是會到個別之道 如果郭董 我說良心話 沒有引進拓仁 我就至少會玩五年以上 我估計 因為現在 在日本他們個別之道 這種業者其實都非常大 他們都是很有規模 那其實我自己以前在 台北新北或是基隆 我自己也覺得我很大 可是問題是我跟他們比起來 我等於是小補習班 所以我常常說 如果站在合作的角度 其實像他們這樣的 有規模的個別之道 是不會 應該不會做到瞧不起我們 但是他覺得跟他之間 是稍微不對等 所以這個點就是要 很感謝康軒 這是我們台灣教科書 最大的品牌 所以說有這樣的一個大哥在 整個那個對等性 就很足夠 所以我才說其實 這個導入我應該比較像是執行者 不過這個 可能轉做個別之道 也跟去就讀台大EMBA 剛好遇到同學 包含海老明 所以後來冠傑、康軒 日本突然就合起來 這也是一個很重要的原因 其實在EMBA來講 我們也算是一個 合作還算 不敢說非常成功 但至少是一個合作成功的過程 因為如果說合伙事業 還是有 大家應該如果投到讀EMBA也是有聽到 合作合伙的 後來就可能 被拆散或是沒有做起來 當然我覺得事業沒有百分之百成功 當時我們在做的時候 也是不知道會不會成功 是 了解了 所以這個其實也是一個很重要的原因 那第二個問題是 團班跟個別之道 成功的因素 我們分別來看 團班可能有哪些成功因素 個別之道又有哪些 我自己覺得團班要成功就兩個 第一個是老師 第二個是管理 我自己歸納的就是這樣 那我覺得個別之道要成功 也是兩個 但是我覺得是精神還有know how 這個know how就是本能 那我們現在 團體班的部分 我想老師很管理這兩個面向 我想 蕭老師你應該也很了解 這一塊 我就不多贅述 但是在個別之道 為什麼我會特別強調是精神跟know how 因為第一個我們當時做個別之道 台灣沒有這樣的技術 所以說我們依靠日本 來到台灣 根據這個know how 在地化 第二個是精神 因為其實台灣大概這五年多 很多人都在模仿個別之道 雨後春水 可是還是 大部分都沒有成功 成功的家族其實很少 那為什麼 我覺得就是精神 在這個層面 那這個部分個別之道有很多 屬於精神跟 人與人之間的這種連結 那這個東西 它沒有一定的 時間 如果光靠模仿的話 沒有辦法說我們成功 這是我自己在看 個別之道跟團體班的 成功關鍵 我大概歸納成兩個 那為什麼團體班我會歸納老師 只要有名師 應該就成功一半以上 團體班 是這樣的概念 像那個家長說明會 或學生的招生說明會 這樣的形象模式 在團班裡面佔很重要的 以前是很重要 家長說明會 或是 甚至如果可以的話 都還想辦法可不可以 到學校去 把我們這個東西傳達出去 所以很多東西我覺得 團體班它還是 這些 我們個別之道的招生 很多東西也是跟團班一樣 只是說因為 既然是個別之道 所以我們這個廣說會 或是這種說明會 我們就不會那麼多人 像我記得我們有幾個 指引的教室 也是有辦國三考前說明會 也是個別之道 個別之道這種廣考前說明會 你會發現來的家長可能只有五個 那這五個如果在以前我們團體班 這辦不起來 大家看到才五個 就覺得團體班很不行 那個別之道的說明會 有五個家長來聽 我們就覺得這是很棒 很成功的說明會 我也可以再舉一個 這次在疫情時期七八月份的時候 當時我們的 托兒的加盟書 他們有在提議說 我們現在國小班的暑假怎麼辦 所以那個時候在托兒這邊 就幫國小 我們就設計了線上夏令營 那這個線上夏令營當時也是廣說會 也是有說明會 我記得有十幾個人來參加 那十幾個人來參加 以個別之道來講十幾個人來參加 就是很不錯的成功的說明會 那後來這些也很多都有參加 這次我們的線上夏令營 線上夏令營 剛好就是這次疫情 那當然因為這次線上夏令營 因為是直接把 托兒的母公司 灌接的屬性的夏令營 線上夏令營 直接導入 所以這個部分也是一個 剛好是母公司跟子公司合作的 在課程上合作的例子 龔總剛才講到精神 那是不是包含類似說 他的自我思考 自我決策 自我行動能力的培養 或者說開啟學生的動力開關 類似像這樣的一個概念 像這些就是一個我覺得精神層面 那我們要落實到在地化 所以說其實 個別之道 很多人就模仿 反正我就是用成一對一對二 因為在台灣 個別之道已經被定義得很狹隘 一對一才是個別之道 其實一對二也不是個別之道 有的家長 其實像現在托兒園在操作上 在日本一對一對二是個別之道 那在日本一對二也是上個比較多 還是同樣做托兒園來講 那台灣呢 反過來我們是一對一比較多 一對二比較少 那為什麼這樣子 因為台灣覺得個別之道就叫一對一啊 那為什麼現在托兒園也叫一對二 因為我們做不下來 課滿了 那我們就要去跟家長協調說 一對二 這是一個 那另外一個就是說 我們也是跟家長溝通說 其實一對二像在日本 為什麼這麼蓬勃發展 因為他們共辦學習是有幫助的 所以說也把一對二 一對二其實在台灣是後來才推廣成功 那如果要舉台灣托兒園最明顯的例子 就是我們的民生校 那時候民生校 已經破百了 甚至到150人的時候 這我相信邱老師的成功教育 應該有類似的問題 只是說這個 實際上我們知道當然如果你翻桌率翻得夠多 你當然還是可以繼續用一對一的操作 但是你沒有辦法一直翻桌率 老師又不夠的時候 勢必要去推動 共辦學習 解決老師不夠 然後我們又希望能夠 讓班級可以順利的開課 那一對二也是一個一定要去做的一個 但是在台灣是反而變成輔助方案 我成功校 雖然他學生量很大 教長還是不願意接受 我已經實驗了 而且算是給他滿大的壓力 可是清豐托兒園是成功的 他幾乎全部一對二 這也來自於可能想像 那一對二的學費畢竟只有一對一的 可能七五到八成 那他們願意嘗試 那到時候我強迫只有這一校成功 再一對二 跟我去日本看到整片都一對二截然不同 雖然比較稍微 不是那麼一級城市 或淡黃區的教室才有比較的機會 我在想這個問題 所以 也有可能是這樣 但因為我們自己在 台灣托兒園成長過程當中 我們的大職校民生校 民生按照設立順序是 民生跟大職校 那這兩個校都是我們的百人上 甚至到後來到150人所有的教室 那這兩個教室當時的 事實上到後來都是 變成一對二 那一對二的原因並不是說一對一都沒有了 還是有一對一 只是說這些一對二的原因都是因為就做不下 其實就是一個教室 容納不下 所以那家長後來 因為他就是一定要上啊 家長現在就在外面排隊 他說我要上托兒園啊 那我們就要跟家長 那你可不可以接受一對二 先來試試看 其實我發現到確實 新生在推廣上 確實比原本 舊生勸成一對二 好像容易一點 在當時實施上是這樣 但我不曉得 畢竟經過這麼多年了 所以說 也有可能市場的轉變 那會不會跟桌椅 因為如果我們是一對二的桌椅 假設我都是擺這樣 那如果上一對一就太浪費 那如果說我擺了很多一對一的桌椅 那其實我在成功校算什麼第二校 我也是這樣做 因為我看到新風托的人都上一對一 可是都是那種一對二的桌椅 我就覺得可惜了 所以到成功校我大概有一半就是一對一的桌椅 一對一的桌椅其實是 來台灣以後我們在地化做的方法 在日本沒有一對一的桌椅 這個我倒是沒有注意 一對一的桌椅是我們 台灣喔 是當時我們整個團隊 大家思考這樣下去不是很好 還有另外一個原因 有些教室的格局 一對二擺不下 就差幾個轉角 很可惜 所以 那我們就把它做成一對一 那個時候日本剛到台灣 看到的時候剛開始不太能接受 當然我還是要用 在地化的角度 試著說服我的合夥人 不過我覺得 這點很不錯的地方就是我覺得 其實松田會長非常尊重台灣 所以他能夠去 認同說 那台灣再來試試看 所以很多其實 合作事業就是這樣 他一定要彼此的包容 跟互相諒解 理解 謝謝 因為那個像一對一的桌椅是 來台灣才有這個倒是 我有覺得真的可以解決台灣的部分問題 尤其有些班子 那個班級的面積真的太小 要不然你都是擺一對一 浪費 教室長是長型的 擺不下 第三個問題 團班跟個別指導可能都會有一些危機 像團班的危機我們可能看得到 那個別指導可能也會 有一些危機如果情形不善 我覺得這兩個危機 有一個點都一樣 是 如果再往後推 就是沒有班主任 跟教室長 現在在整個團班跟個別指導 面臨最大危機 我覺得是這兩個 那為什麼這兩個 其實這個可能就是自己踩自己腳 因為拓展改變了台灣的 補教生態 所以我們需要 大量的老師 就像以前我們太團體班 反正靠我國旗校一個就好 或者靠秋天老師一個就好 其他都是 當助理就行了 現在不是這樣 現在每一個老師都很重要 我們現在是沒有老師了 所以我覺得可能的危機 也是最大的危機 就是沒有老師 那沒有老師的下個階段 就是沒有班主任跟教室長 班主任就是團班 就是個別指導的機構 所以這是我覺得 目前面臨 這已經不是可能了 它是已經面臨了 我的意見是這樣子 可是郭董因為 補習班可能在2014年 它到達最高峰大約是1900 19000多家 那像以現在來講大概17000多家 所以剛才我們講說 可能因為個別指導我們會覺得說 補習班變多了 可是事實上補習班它整體的量 並沒有變多 所以講師可能需求 會真的不夠 因為像個別指導一個教室可能需要的講師量 是非常非常大 可是以班主任而言 它並沒有需求變大 所以這個你們覺得 那因為我為什麼會 我自己當然這個部分 我還沒有做學術上的論述 或者是做調查 那我自己的觀察是因為 還是回到現在的 年輕人 現在的年輕人 其實不喜歡做補習班 就好像我以前也常講說 少子化是問題嗎 當然是問題 但是為什麼現在我們學生越來越少 因為學生不喜歡來上補習班 那在就職的角度 你現在大學生的角度 他們可能會覺得 至少我從我 從我兒子的同學 你們大家喜歡做什麼 我真的一眼望去都沒有 都沒有做補習班的 都是麥當勞 Uber Eats Foodpanda 他們覺得這個工作自由 快樂沒有壓力 那雖然薪水沒有像補習班的老師 薪水比較高 可是他們覺得他們做的很快樂 又可以交朋友 而是像到速食店去工作 我覺得供給端也減少了 那你想想看 我們以前很多 我們現在 以我自己貫解公司的班主任 這些班主任後來都變成我股東 每一個都是學生時代就在我們貫解公司 那我們現在這種 從學生時代當老師的人 接下來畢業後來當班主任的 這塊 幾乎都快斷掉了 我自己在看 整個團班 我覺得危機是只有這兩項 所以您看到就是說老師跟市長 這也來自於說 年輕人都不願意再加入這個行業 也都有相關 是 因為還是有願意加入 像你兒子們都願意 但是 在比例上 我們自己回想我們那個時代 我們班上當老師在兼職 你班有一半以上 當然還有另外一半 就是最喜歡到中油 那時候加油站的 終點費最高 80幾那時候覺得非常神奇 加油站 跟補習班老師 幾乎是整個大學生的工讀獨立 所以說這樣的人才 他升上來以後 我們班主任級的人才當然多 可是現在 全班做補習班 可能只有三個或五個 整個比例上差距太大 以前人多 可選職才也多 好 郭董第四個問題 您的個別指導發展策略 這個我可能把題目就類似定義為 假設托人的個別發展策略 可能是類似什麼加盟啊 合資合營啊 或者是品牌授權的 都可以 我個別指導策略 站在托人角度 我當時就覺得 要跟日本一樣 就是要複製一個動力開關機 在台灣 這當時也是我們 三位創辦人 曾經在一些會議當中提過的 這是我們希望的 發展策略 如果要以台灣托人這家公司的角度 我們的發展策略就是 複製一個日本的動力開關機 在台灣 那這個策略從以前到現在 我們就一直做這樣的執行 那我也是用這樣的策略在做 那當然 我是有 還是要強化 怎麼樣讓這些品牌 有機會到台灣準備在地化 就像剛才我們聊到的 我們個人指導的客座椅 我們有一對一的客座椅 但這個在日本托人可能是沒有的 那所以說 有些東西來到台灣 還是要回到這個 怎麼樣把這些 發展策略上 落實在地化 以目前來講 我確實沒有自己 在個別指導的發展策略 就純粹我個人去發想的東西 那我發想的東西 只是在地化的東西 這個部分確實在我們台灣 個別指導這塊 我們有做一些 蠻重要的貢獻 不過 如果說要以策略來講 目前是沒有 但是呢 有一點我覺得 倒是我們學習的日本不錯的東西 就是我們目前的發展 事實上是以數量為主 然後是 已經做補習班的 這種 夥伴為輔 那這是整個台灣托人 在成長策略上的架構 那這個架構呢 其實也是學習之門 所以說 所以我才會講說 如果要以個別指導 我自己的發展策略來講 比較不好意思講 就是模仿日本 但是如果說 以一個比較 學術上的講法 就是我們把他的策略 在地化在台灣 就原汁原味的帶進來 那因為現在其實 說還有明光啊 高明他們講的一個品牌加入 我就說那我們在面對 可能競爭對手的 這個部分我們會有一些什麼樣的 比如說我們到底好在哪裡 或者說我們要怎麼去 講對抗也可以講說 跟敵人要競爭 這個策略呢 你的公司已經立了很多很棒的標準 那個就是最好的策略 是 我是這樣覺得 因為像其他 這些當然明光還是從日本來的 他地有他很好 他精神這樣 所以他如果能夠 把他在地化跟複製的成功 他也是很有機會成功 但是因為 現在明光可能在台灣 我覺得他要面臨的問題是說 他會讓台灣的家長覺得 你就不是個別之童 這還是根本的問題 這也是為什麼到後來 我覺得會有家長會覺得說 我好像感覺有點 好像有點受騙了 事實上當時跟我講個別之童 但實際上不是 那可是我覺得 我相信明光的出發點 不是要騙人家 因為他們的做法就是 我就是這樣分配式的學習 分配式學習 我的認知上我還是幫你個別指導 可是這個東西就是跟家長 的認知不一樣 那我想這也是現在的托人 如果說我們要真的說策略上 我們跟人家最大的一個 不同 我們就真的是一對一 厚真假實的一對一 我們也沒有什麼 混在一起 用一對三一對四 或是一對五一對六 然後分配式的學習 我們就真的是一對一 他們可能在強調說 假設我同時教三個學生 在教A的時候 BC這時候自己練習嘛 所以他強調說獨立思考跟自主學習 那教B的時候 AC就是獨立思考跟自主學習 有點把缺點化成優點 的說法 那問題 家長就說我就是要來找個別指導 他可能心裡想不是這樣一對一 那你們的教室長也跟我講 對我們是個別指導 結果進去以後小孩子回來跟我講 媽媽我今天怎麼老師只給我上十幾分鐘 那其他我都在心裡 做考卷 那當然家長一定會翻臉 我覺得這是常識 但我不知道為什麼 他們要採取這樣的策略 如果是我 我就坦白告訴家長 我就是小組學習的 我就是一對三一對五一對六 我就是這樣上課 但是我會有一些時段個別教你的孩子 坦白講反而比較好 那搞不好家長覺得 我先試試看 就像為什麼現在民光還是有一些成功的教室 因為有些家長就是 他進來雖然補 本來補個別指導 可是他還是有進步 也沒有差 學費也不用像托那麼貴 那就上這個好了 那孩子的功課還是有進步 不過我有一個小小的想法 因為個別指導都沒有定義 我查在網路這麼多也沒有 後來我看到這麼多年下來 我認為他應該說 從一對一到一對四 在同時間只針對一個人教學 我們叫個別指導 這就是高明為什麼敢說他是一對一 他那四個雖然同學科 可是不同年級 那我同時間可能只能針對一個人在教 那民光他三個人 可能還不同年級不同學科 所以他也是同時間教一個 所以他們叫個別指導 那我甚至覺得說像我們托文這麼高級的做法 他應該說 從一對一 應該說一對一從頭到尾 針對一個人教學我們叫個人指導 我就直接針對你專屬服務 那因為我都找不到定義 所以我只能自己去下一個類似這樣的定義 因為托文是最早 開始在台灣做這個 所以我們一開始就 我們其實也把定義給 變得很狹隘 因為我在台灣 我們本來就是一對一 我們一開始就是一對一 我們都 只是托文因為我們是一對一 我們的招牌上是 把日本這樣原汁原味搬過來 所以我們還是主打一對一 還是主打一對一一對二 可是事實上我們在一開始就一對一 我們從一開始 創業在詢問家長 沒有人直接一開始問我們一對二 很難 所以說既然是這樣 這已經是市場的趨勢 我們就直接把它定為個別指導就是一對一 當然那樣的一個定位或許 對我們托文在 現在或未來的發展上 可以繼續維持我們的 品牌優勢 如果說我們現在反而把 這個個別指導的定義 變成多人的話 那可能就會 或許會影響到我們的品質 那萬一家長也普遍性都認為 個別指導就是一對一到一對六 像日本那樣都算個別指導的話 這樣其實站在市場的發展上 我覺得對台灣 個別指導發展不見得是很好 所以說現在 反而要去強調 一對一就是個別指導 那還好現在我們的家人都這麼認為 那應該很少 很少家長會覺得一對二或一對三 是個別指導 這是我覺得值得高興跟欣慰的地方 可是一旦 這個一對一 門檻立了這麼高以後 這也就是會造成我們剛才在提到的 對失職 危機了 因為所有人在說我們自己砸自己的腳 我們托文 我們開始托文沒有找不到好事的問題 現在大家找不到好事 太多個別指導 隨便一個教室 都是二三十個老師 像貴公司比較大校 那可能找不到五六十個老師 在裡面 一個補習班 不是說 以前五六十個老師 是我們團體班 如果以我來講 我是在五六個補習班 才需要到 五六十個老師 現在不是 一個補習班可能就五六十個老師 所以這是 這也是麻煩 所以我們就把老師分級 希望從一對一到一對二到一對四到小團 第一個節省資質 第二他的營收也提高 他的薪水拿的多獎金拿的多他也願意留下來 這也是不得不為 這就是 你的公司的一個策略 每個人一定有他的發展策略 對啊 一對一可能專業專屬那一對四營收高 然後獎資省 這個部分就是 但是有一個前提 那是因為目前 一對四成功的業者 但我看很多一對四也不能做起來 很有可能 我看到好幾個失敗的 之後我們就不要講名字了 他也是後來就做不起來了 後來就沒了啊 他還是就改回小組團班 他就不去定位一定要一對四 就是又回到 可能有的班是幾個 有的班兩三個 沒有主軸啊 最後還是亂掉 沒有主軸就沒有文化沒有思想 第五個問題是 像拓仁主要本來是一對一到一對二 明光是一對三 像高明是一對四 假設以這樣的一個型態來講 你覺得未來的主流趨勢可能會 因為獎勵也會越來越少 我覺得主流趨勢可能 從一對一到一對四 都會有人做 因為這個部分就是 他現在市場就是這樣 就以 我剛開始跟 康軒跟 影后一起合作拓仁的時候 我自己覺得他做一對四 那當時 只是我自己 我自己很明確去做一對四的定義 可是在我 那個時候的團班 也很多團體班 他都是小組教學的 那個時候的一些兒童美語的補習班 他們就是小組教學都很多 只是他們的小組不見得是定位說一定四個 他們有的可能有六個 有的可能有八個 也有可能有四個 我覺得那個時候其實就是這個樣子 但你也不可能去阻礙 那種 你無法阻礙小組教學的 那個 那個 這個市場 因為他還是一個蠻成熟的市場 我自己這樣看一下 我20如果再往前推 2001年我開始在做分組 當然真正 真正開始一對四比較明確的 也是大概在 2002跟2003 可是剛開始我開始 執行分組策略的時候 那個時候其實台灣就有蠻多人 做這種小班 只是那個時候他們不叫小組 或分組他們就叫小班教學 以前的招牌就是 台北那時候在2002到2003 就有很多人在做小班 哇這麼快 那時候小班教學很多耶 只是我們那時候開玩笑說 小班教學是怎麼樣 他們的小班他們覺得 一般15個人很小 可是現在一般15個我們家長覺得 算中型或大型 這是時代的不同 那特別在我一對一到一對四 我覺得他應該就是會 就是會各取所需 各有市場 不同的取向 那只是說 我還是非常的 堅持要有那個 精神跟know how 所以我覺得Tor一定要堅持 這個一對一 跟別人不同 這個是一定的 像我自己的公司 我的Pi4我一定也就堅持一對四 因為我要維持我的精神跟know how 所以很多東西 這種東西就是我覺得 是可能 像我這種精緻型的公司 他成功的關鍵 那如果我自己就把它做亂掉 做偏掉 那也不會說不成功 那也不會說不成功 反正我每個都要收 我有收一對一,我有收一對三,我有收一對四 我有收一對八的 我有那個 我們這樣講啊 Tor在寒暑假他們也是有 那個 他們叫講席會啊 講席會一個班也是十幾個二十幾個 但他沒有偏離了 他的原始精神 為什麼? 他是寒暑假才這樣做 那為什麼寒暑假才這樣做 因為寒暑假 除了原本課程,我們有一些要總複習的課程 或怎麼樣 他們也是要升學啊 那這樣也可以減輕他們的負擔 所以就有講席會 那因為 我剛才問到這樣 其實我後來看到一些論文 或者是看到日本的網站 我有請人把它從 日文翻成中文 我覺得整個結局來講 一對一他可能屬於貼身式教學 對我們來講 我覺得最好,效果最佳 那一對二我們叫面對面教學 我教A,那B練習 我教B,A練習,面對面教學 那一對四我們叫小組討論,集思共學 當然我們也要美化我們的 就像說我們認為我們脫冷藤 是全程式教學 而明光教巡迴式輔導 那這我講的那天有一點我在 打擊敵人 凸顯他的缺點的部分 還是郭董覺得說 這些方式都有一定的市場 或一定的人的比例 也許金字塔頂端人會先選一對一 再次是一對二 再來是一對四,再不行就團拜 我覺得這個市場 大概一定就是 最後就是一個百家爭 只是說他的百家爭是 不一定都是一對一 所以這也是為什麼我覺得 我們如果能夠把這個一對一 堅持好 各位知道這個一對一堅持好 我還是覺得 有獨特的市場 而且不容易被取代 我覺得 就像脫冷 在成長過程當中 我們可能遇到一些瓶頸,遇到一些困難 可是只要克服那些困難 跟解決那些問題以後 他就又恢復 從我們好幾個教室 原本可能突然下墜或下降 把他拉回去 我常常舉一個我們公司高雄分校的例子 就是最好的例子 那就是一個典型 剛開始不錯的話,上升到一個階段 然後後來哇 脊椎的下降 現在哇,上升,上升到比原本的還要再高 甚至都已經是百年以上的教室 而且說實在 我覺得 如果我沒有在統計錯誤的話 他應該是南部地區 最大的個別指導教室 南部沒有超過100以上 我說的是個別指導教室 所有包含其他品牌 加減來的 包含現在在 南部的明光也沒有人破百的 我說的是 百人以上教室 所以說這個東西就是一個 我覺得他還是一定有他的 獨特性 只要能夠把那個精神跟 know how掌握好 那當然我們可以再配合一點 因為那個市場也很強 四三公倍 是,那郭總 第六個題目是這樣 可能 以日本來講,現在個別指導可能佔 整個市場大概45% 那當然也有講到50% 那台灣可能在2-3% 甚至有講到3-4% 大概就在這一段 可能從我們產品生命週期來看 從導入期進到 剛開始的成長初期 那你預測大概10年後 他會呈現怎麼樣的分佈 那個別指導的比例大約會在 什麼樣的狀況 因為我覺得台灣的市場 這題我也想了一下 應該都想蠻久了 如果以我 我現在台灣這樣來看 因為台灣目前的狀況 目前這樣的發展 其實就是跟日本 幾乎都一樣 那這樣的情況 如果我們用這樣來推估 我是覺得10年後 台灣應該也是4-6% 就是個別指導大概是40% 那也有可能佔45% 團體班 在我定義的團體班 就是1-2、1-3以上 這種小團、中團、大團都一樣 這些應該還是會佔到 60%左右 那為什麼我會這樣來判斷 第一個我首先把1-1 我先把個別指導定位在1-1 以及1-2的輔助 這樣的一個狀況 我覺得要做像Torrent這樣 專屬1-1這樣的業者 如果能夠在10年後 衝到整個台灣 比較市場的40% 我個人覺得已經非常厲害了 所以共同學會到40% 如果假設我們補習班 現有大概1萬7 那我們把它減少到1萬5好了 那1萬5的40%大概就要6千家 那6千家第一個 個別指導6千家感覺上 那應該是 密佈在這個區域 那可能因為有些區域 它的收入比較低 第二是假設真的有6千家 那需要的師資台灣有辦法供應嗎 所以這會不會有一些稍微 這就是衝突的地方 我昨天在家裡面 想這個問題的時候 如果我們發展到跟日本一樣 有40%或甚至45%的話 我們台灣可能 我們會有師資跟工資的問題 所以我說 其實我那個時候 很難預測 這個題目我很難去找到答案 但為什麼我還是用 4-6-1來當成一個預測 是因為 如果以日本這樣的一個市場發展下來 那如果台灣 因為台灣現在比較像日本 還相對起來在市場的感覺 還是比較像日本 那中國不用講 因為中國已經全部都個別指導 他們已經整個體系上 個別指導反而是主力 團班反而不是主力 它的團體班是比個別指導少 所以在這樣的情況 我們也沒有辦法說 參考中國市場 它畢竟是一個 比較新的一個強大的經濟體 但如果說是 同樣是亞洲 然後穩定的經濟體 這樣看下來的話 日本跟韓國的樣子 應該還是一個台灣比較 可以參考的 那韓國來講 它其實也是跟我們台灣有點像 郭董你有聽過韓國的數據嗎 我蠻好奇的 韓國的數據喔 我以前是聽日本做講的時候 他們個別指導的部分 當然也是還是 萌芽階段 但那個時候是沒有 像日本 突然開始去做韓國的時候 韓國是以前有個別指導 那個時候是已經有 所以這是不太一樣 那拓仁在韓國有幾家 這個數據我是不曉得 因為好像比較慢才去開展韓國 那時候是 那位錦上 後來是當那邊的總經理 這我就 這我沒有數據 沒有問過這個問題 但是我是為什麼會覺得 參考日本是因為 這跟我們的 那個感覺 這個市場的感覺是比較像 還是因為可能從 日本先有少子化 我們也跟著少子化 或日本從負利率我們慢慢也幾乎是平利率 有點類似的概念 因為台灣人好像 比較 喜歡日本的一些產品 或一些日本的親神 那也許也因為台灣可能被日本殖民過 所以跟日本的屬性 感覺上那個 調性會比較接近 是跟這個有關嗎 至少如果從 現在個別指導的資料上來看 那個 日本應該是我們台灣 比較好的參考方式 就像中國的個別指導 他們也是發展得很成熟 但是我目前是沒有看到 台灣有人導入中國的個別指導 到台灣來做 目前沒有 只有中國想要導入台灣 之前有找我好幾次 還好沒去 要不然其實就掛了 剛好在雙劍 我本來就覺得水太深 因為中國 這真的也是很難想像 不過因為我是指說 因為如果要以個別指導這個角度 中國發展得比我們早 所以說 他的運作應該也會 相對比台灣成熟 但是台灣沒有人去導入中國 所以說我才會說 我沒有辦法去從中國市場來研判 台灣有沒有可能在十年後跟中國一樣 個別指導為主 台灣反而是那個少數 那我覺得我自己的看法上 可能還是會比較接近日本 因為即使我們現在個別指導這麼好 可是團體反而是 佔百分之九幾 我們要從百分之這種 還是個位數的百分比 要變到四十 我覺得這其實是很有難度 而且只有十年 對不對 所以你還是覺得十年大概會是勢必兩 大概是四十六十台 對 我覺得這很極限 我們就這樣講 未來的十年 能夠出現幾家像台灣托人這樣的公司 我為什麼這樣形容 台灣托人現在的狀況 我們也才七十幾個教室 對不對 那明光這個部分 能不能被認定為個別指導教室 這當然 如果把它認定進來的話 我們現在幾個主力這樣加一加 可能我看加起來 四五百而已 如果連航班都加一加 如果把這種 如果你把高明這種都算成個別指導 全部把這種都加進來 我看應該四五百加 也最多這樣 其實也是3%不到 所以這是一個 我覺得很冷門 那如果說我們再把個別指導 如果繼續照托人一開始在台灣創立的時候 這種定義 一對一才叫個別指導 那現在的高明跟明光那都不能算 那這個要拼到四成 相當的 是 要有很多家 像托人這樣的公司 這樣的連鎖品牌 我都是做一對一的 同時這樣競爭跟PK 或許有可能拼到 這種價格 其實我心裡是認為 如果它真的很 當然我們個別指導要分成幾種 假設我們現在把高明跟 明光那種都廣義的 當作個別指導 甚至把Pi4 都把它算進來 這種都把它當作個別指導的話 那我覺得我們要拼四成 但如果我們要以台灣托人所定義的 台灣的個別指導 也是家長心目中的一對一 個別指導 我都覺得拼到10%都很厲害 10%就 現在如果一萬五千 就一千五百間 在整個台灣 一千五百間的一對一個別指導 精緻化教學 我覺得很有難度 是 郭董感謝你今天 把這時間談給我 有點又遲到了 那就 錄音就先 謝謝\n"

    "我幫你寫成陳執行長，柳英文教還是你公司要？是要柳英文教嗎？對柳英文教，好，那開始錄了嗎？開始。那趙子從團班獲利的不錯。那會想要轉做個別指導的人真的不多，那你是其中一個。你為什麼會有這樣的一個想法呢？剛開始當然是因為你的關係，是我喔，這個我們很老實說。那但是在我們整個投入之後，發現團班的獲利不錯。它其實是一種高招生率跟高流失率的現象。所以呢，在後來我接受了你的一個意見之後，在個別指導把一些比較需要特別關照的學生轉過去之後，發現可以大大延長他的報名時期。那個時間，原本已經要GG的學生，要掛掉的學生，但是挪過去之後，他甚至有些可以錄補到高三畢業。所以這個當然是一個非常全面性的，把學生留下來的一個好的商模。因此，在從團班獲利不錯的時候，轉型做個別指導，純粹我們說獲利考量，而且可以更全面地發展。這個倒是跟他們的觀點不一樣。我自己在看的狀況是，在全台灣左手團班右手個別指導，我們補習班算是做得最好的，因為包含最近的帳號，個別指導都沒有運作起來。團班跟個別指導做到都有一定的規模，我認為我們是一個很特別的模式。第二個，團班跟個別指導成功的。你講到第二題了，你第一題講完了，你還需要什麼我可以再多講？我還想說團班獲利不錯，團班獲利不錯你會轉型做個別指導，是不是你有一些想法？或者說你看到也許團班，因為我不太適合引導你，團班也許我們在看到他已經有一點。那我怎麼為未來打算？或者說團班已經是個紅海的現象，那我們就要找尋第二曲線，類似這樣。其實這在當年你跟我講的時候的狀況，這其實是不存在的，因為在台北當時都還是高招生率，在當時還有三十幾萬的考試生的狀況之下，其實那時候正是我營收最高的時候。我營收最高的時候，整體而言，他是沒有看到向下的曲線。但是其實你的一個觀點，什麼觀點？就是未來學生數一定會越來越少。學生數如果減少，但是我們的學生的流失比例，如果仍然是這麼高的話，那這個流失比例高，大概是兩成，每一個上留下下留下都固定會有兩成的學生流失的狀況之下，這個是一個很大的損失。在學生人流多的時候是沒有感覺的，因為流失兩成補進來兩成一兩成二，他其實都還是會有正成長的狀況。但是在三年五年後，他可能就會面對到學生，從北北基原本從八萬到七萬五到六萬多，到現在只剩五萬多的狀況之下，你的分母不斷在降低的時候，分子也會同步的降低，但是我們的經營成本沒有改變，所以必得要另外開拓新的學生來源，個別指導就是一個非常好的管道。所以你的意思是說，可能原來來自於新北要進入台北市的學生也在減少，整個已經少子化，新北來到台北又減少，所以只能到個別指導開闢第二個區間或第二個裁員，他基本上跟團班是相輔相成，既能夠獨立招生，又能夠吸納團班的資質好的跟資質不好的都可以吸納，所以這在我們補習班來講算是，而且還有特殊需求的學生也可以吸納，這在我們補習班來講算是一個非常好的商源。我講說什麼叫特殊需求？例如說考私立中學在台北是非常盛行的。但是一般人只補國文跟數學，可是英文科他有特殊需求，所以我們的私中的英文班招的就特好，因為我們團班只開國文數學，他可以補足團班的不足，跟相輔相成的一個概念。所以基本上，只要是我們的團班附近，一定都有我們的個體。還是有人英文就是不夠強，這個觀點不錯，我覺得蠻特別的。\n",
    "\n",
    "第二個像團班跟個別指導都有一些成功的關鍵。像團班可能有一些個別指導有一些。假設我們分開來談這個問題，你覺得團班成功的關鍵，這應該理論上你比我擅長很多。團班的成功關鍵就是三個，一個是班務，一個是教務，一個是招生。這個就是團班發展的三隻腳。班務的部分基本上要做到讓家長沒有抱怨，這個是非常重要的。那這個其實要找的是有經驗而且心繫的人去做服務。\n",
    "\n",
    "那再來是教務的部分，就是授課師的安排，還有所有的輔導的規劃。這個如果做得好，學生的留班率就高。像最近我一直著墨在教務上面，就是因為要提高學生的留班率。你剛有提到說班務是要細心，那教務你覺得是專業嗎？教務是要，專業是一個。那教務除此之外還有勤練系，這個可能如果說換成剛剛講的應該是耐心。\n",
    "\n",
    "那再來招生，其實才是補習班的命脈。所以招生的關鍵我認為兩個，一個是口碑，一個是行銷。團班基本上走的是，在我們補習班來講走的是名師體系。所以透過名師的教學，我們可以讓學生的學習的曲線急速的拉升，而可以在短時間之內看到學習的成效。這個就叫口碑，家長口耳相傳。那再來是行銷的部分，我們最近透過廣告的多元化。這個廣告多元化能再說明詳細一點嗎？例如說Youtube行銷，例如說網頁行銷，例如說文宣是最傳統的文宣行銷。這些都是屬於廣告多元化。有用Google關鍵字，你網頁算Google跟FB都算嗎？對FB也算。那活動行銷，例如萬聖節等等。我們透過很多元的方式，讓自己在疫情期間，可以還維持到跟去年相當的招生量。\n",
    "\n",
    "那再來是，剛剛提到少子化。其實在少子化的狀況之下，整體的營收應該要向下走才對。所以我們透過數位課程的切入，曾經你請我去段純真吃牛肉麵，我認為他的小菜營業額可能跟牛肉麵不相上下。所以我在這個思維當中，我開啟了一種叫做小菜課程。學生沒有社會科，所以我就拍社會科的段付影片。你補了國文科，沒有補我生物科，我就拍生物科的段付影片。我把國三最需要的文言閱測拿出來拍成閱讀測驗的系列影片。透過包裝，透過行銷，透過根據你的成績的狀況，去對你做個別化的推薦，讓家長明白說我們看到他學生的需求，當然他也樂於買單。因此，我們在這兩年的營業額是往上，每一年都是二十幾%往上走。這指的是數位課程嗎？不是，是整體的營業額。可是主要是來自於數位課程的增加嗎？數位課程增加幫很大的忙。數位課程的營業額在2020年已經達到了九百五十萬以上，那今年2021年到目前為止，已經達到一千三百萬以上。所以這個應該叫做經營的多元化，還有經營思維的突破。\n",
    "\n",
    "個別指導呢，個別指導面臨的危機，在新竹不是一個危機，但在台北卻是一個危機。剛才個別指導成功的關鍵，所以成功還在第二題。剛才是團班嗎？現在是個質成功的關鍵。我們可以分成幾項。第一個是個別指導成功的關鍵，善於學習魔法。因為我說真的，前輩走在前面，每次跟你談完之後，我們就開會，開會之後就學習。學習之後，像接下來一月份，就是我們要跟員工聊一聊架動率，就是要跟員工聊一聊師資成本率的這些概念。我覺得學習魔法的部分是養分的來源，這是第一個。首先要感謝你。第二個是，我幫你再多寫配對。這是第一個，第二個是我們的個別指導其實是在台北經營。我認為從危機轉進成功當然是比較順，但是我先講成功。成功的部分是拉高了毛利率，因為台北的房租太貴，所以我們的毛利率一直拉不起來。2019年，我們的毛利率是6%，做了一整年賺6%，是淨利還是毛利？毛利。我講，我們講，單扣那些人事成本，就只扣成本還沒談到費用，還沒談到那個，就是應該是說，我應該是這樣講比較精準，就是還沒課稅前的那一段。那是其實還是淨利，是稅前淨利。稅前淨利6%。所以這蠻可惜的，這一件事讓我非常的震驚，因為我們是有很精準的每一筆項目都登錄於財務報表上，所以收入可以到將近千萬九百八十幾萬，那居然他的獲利一間分銷獲利6%，對這個實在是匪夷所思。所以我們透過了幾項步驟來做。第一個是拉高學手，所以在跟邱老師你在合作的那一段時間，我們訂有所謂的秋天跟柳營版本的那個學收的部分，等到2019年的要邁入2020年，我們就單獨訂專屬於柳營的那個學收。第一個是拉高學收，第二個是從一對一轉入一對二、一對四。簡單說就是不再開一對一，因為在台北經營一對一會賠錢，也都創造一個講是單小時的營收，是拉高變高了，對沒有錯。那再來第三個，是特攝小團的開設。所以像我們針對例如說閱讀書養的特攝小團，例如說師中英文的特攝小團，或者是顏評專班的特攝小團，用這樣子的模式走出我們自己的一些特色，那當然它就會有相當的一個獲利提升。那再來第四個是數位課程的介入。數位課程的介入的這一塊，它是用在一對二或一對四上面。那我們甚至學習教練就是市長本人，我連學習教練的錢其實都沒有花，那這個就是我們的存獲率。所以透過這樣子的一個四個方式，我們把個別指導往上，就是拉到成功的一個模式。稍等一下，再來是這講第三題了嗎？稍等一下，再來是客製化的服務，包含我們有全職授課師跟兼職授課師的排課平台。透過排課的平台，我們可以讓排課更靈活，簡單說以往我們可能都是全職授課師的比重比較高，那我們現在透過排課平台可以讓兼職授課師一併加入的狀況，我們每一個時段的學生，你想要什麼時段我們都可以找到老師，那也增加排課率。我覺得這個算是比較特別，因為以前為了要排一個課，電話打到爆，用人工，現在我們只要上排課平台，再來個別指導面臨的危機。先說團班，團班面臨的最大危機是少子化。少子化衍生出來的危機就多了，所以所有的危機都來自於少子化。少子化不只有一個危機，它是系統性的危機或系統性風險。因此，團班的收入不夠，所以才無法請到郝老師。另外，政府的規費不斷調漲，這也是因為整個少子化的情況下，成本增加而收入減少。這是最根本的危機，主要原因是學生量不夠大，而且這個情況還會愈演愈烈，是不可逆轉的。因此，這是團班可能面臨的危機。\n",
    "\n",
    "另外，所有的危機都來自於成本的增加，包括休假制度的改變和補教業人才的稀缺。過去面試找到一個合格的人只需要面試五個人，現在卻要面試十幾個人都找不到一個，因為人們覺得從事補教業可能很辛苦或者看不到希望。個別指導面臨的危機則是房租成本過高，這在台北是一個問題，但在新竹根本不是。此外，停收太高占掉了一個分校，所以個別指導的發展面臨的第二個危機是人事成本控制的問題，主要來自施以成本率和行政部門。由於基本工資不斷調漲，授課師的成本也會不斷增加，在個別指導面臨的第二個危機是基本工資的提高。第三個危機是經濟因素，只有科學園區等地方才有人氣，而台北卻感到蕭條，這是因為疫情和長時間的物價通膨導致家長可支配收入減少。在台北，很多家長在個別指導後直接選擇團班，這是台北與新竹不同的現象。\n",
    "\n",
    "所以我認為個別指導面臨的最大危機來自於經濟環境的增長，當家長可支配收入高時，他們才會慷慨解囊。現在由於通膨，新竹對通膨的感受並不強烈，因為新竹的可支配收入成長率遠高於通膨，所以人們會覺得新竹很富裕。但台北整體薪資增長率停滯，甚至有微幅增長，尤其是受到疫情影響的行業，他們根本沒有調薪空間。因此，在今年家長要支付費用感到非常辛苦。非常困難，因此我認為大環境是個別指導的最主要的危機。在台北而言，我知道畢竟他是一個相對比較奢侈的。那第四個問題說，您的課品指導發展策略可能有人會知音嗎？有人可能會洽謀，有人會合資合營嗎？可能有各種可能因素，甚至有一個品牌授權。那針對你自己的部分，你會做什麼樣的一個策略安排？個別指導在我們體系算是四大引擎之一，那我們的四顆大引擎分別是團班的營收，再來是個子的營收，再來是數位課程的營收，最後是外派實質的營收。所以我底下要談的個別指導的發展策略其實是這四個營收的綜合的一個策略。原因是因為數位，在我們補習班其實它叫做DNA。我們補習班包含學生或者包含我們自己的課程，本身數位的比重非常重。所以我們兩個到隔壁去。所以我們的個別指導的發展策略，基本上兩個方向來做。第一個是就我自己而言，未來我會走數位個別指導的模式，並且推出概念效跟加農效。概念效跟加農效分別要怎麼定義？概念效的意思是我們會有指引效，那這個指引會透過這個概念去研發出我們的商模或者是我們的運作模式。 學生原本需要一個授課師才能在旁邊教，但是現在我們未來打算走的是市長就是學習教練。那我們會有集體的解題中心，這集體解題中心就是讓每一個上完課的學生都可以來發問。集體解題中心，那再來是我們會有自己的題庫平台，自行研發題庫平台。那個解題中心是不是有點類似說學習教練坐在這邊，他自動在自己看自己讀自己做題目之後來發問。對，那這個是線上的，是線上的，我沒有辦法把解題老師放在五顆，一共要五個人，我放在每一間分校都放一個，都放各五個這樣很奇怪。所以我們會有研發，例如我們的總部可以做一個解題中心的概念館，是即時性的嗎？即時性的，所以他題目丟上來之後可能國書院就只對一個老師，然後就一直回答這樣。是的，沒有錯。那除此之外，我們的題庫影音題庫平台，它是收集近五年的全台灣各我們收集得到的學校的考題，來做挑題來做錄影。所以這些題目都是符合108課綱的題目。我們只要是你這題做錯了，就按一下旁邊的play，就有數位影音老師。所以是QR code嗎？ 不是，就直接旁邊的箭頭直接按，按箭頭就可以了。對，連QR code都不用。那以前那個QR code是這算是QR code的更高端、更進階版？ 是，專人即時專人解說，對，是的沒有錯。就是我們的題目你可以在線上即時觀看，那就學校的題目你可以透過即時的線上的解題平台去做解題，是的，是的。那因此這樣子的一個模式是未來我們目前在研發的商務模式，是的，那透過這樣子的一個發展，這叫概念校、加盟校。加盟校的部分就會透過這樣子的概念校去往外推廣，所以這個意思就是說指引校就是個示範校，以後你們就是根據我們的模式運作就對了，對未來大概會有10校，10間分校左右的那個，10間分校左右的一個指引校，對其他的會往外推加盟。寫完之後會不會姿余來找我？不會，這個東西我會鎖五年，所以看不到。那再來第二個是現在正在做的，就是開放數位的授權。剛才那跟加盟校的差異是說，加盟校是整體一起，應該說跟你們整個概念校是複製吧。你說剛才那個數位的授權，只是純粹把數位這個課程交給他而已，對沒有錯。開放數位授權因為這個是數位的課程，可以鎖在這個固定IP當中，所以一間分校一個授權是鎖地址對不對？對鎖那個當然也是鎖地址。但是其實你一個分校只能申請固定IP的部分，就是這一家分校申請不了他的那個，其他的就是說只能在這間分校的，他那個IP應該是說比如說中華電信拉了一個，就那一個啦，他只能在這裡用就對了，對沒有錯他帶不走。好，所以我未來打算走這兩個方向，去做個別指導的發展策略，因為拓仁的品牌，他因為拓仁的品牌不見得是值得我繼續往下加碼的品牌。我這樣講拓仁我在做十年，他十年後的那個樣子跟十年前的樣子不會有太大的不一樣。那在我如果要在雙北做，我仍然要去克服掉房租人事老師，然後那個排客等等的問題。所有的問題都是一樣的。那當然很多人會覺得說那不會啊，你可以建立學習曲線，你可以縮短你的那個設立分校的一個讓他快速進入軌道的時間，但是我認為說拓仁的模式，他其實是不是我心中想要的模式，因為他的毛利率太低了。所以我剛剛沒有講，我剛剛透過那四個改變的手段，我讓他在一年之內，2019年跨到2020年，2019年是6%，2020年是18%。那今年2021年應該沒有機會拉到25%。拉到25%，但是應該23%應該是有，是是是，預估值，是的是的。所以在我來看，如果沒有透過改變拓仁原有的模式，在台北經營拓仁，他其實就是必得要面對到高房租到什麼的，所有的成本都高的狀況之下，我還是用了比較高的收費方案，我才賺6%。所以這個是一個，我甚至認為這是個騙局。但是我說的這個概念不是說邱老師你的那個模式不對，其實你的模式在新竹是對的，在台北房租只會更高，台北房租不會有降下來的一天。所以我甚至認為拓仁的台北的所有的分校，能做到越獲利，我們講年獲利能夠做到10%以上的基本上不存在，這當然是個人的一個沒有關係。那第五個題目，個別指導像Torn的部分主要一對一對二為主，那明光是一對三，高明是一對四，那你覺得哪一種才是未來的主流呢？我覺得一對四才是未來的主流。這個原因是，像邱老師你發展的一對四的模式是對的，你的模式是對的，但是你前期要經過一段的等待期。例如說你在他原本一對四的時候，這個原本是要經過一對一加一對二，然後一對三到一對四，他中間可能已經經過了幾個禮拜了。那在我的看法當中，一對四他比較符合商模跟獲利的一個主流，但是他的做法我認為其實可以更靈活，因為在台北要做到同學科同學年同學科甚至要做到同程度，他其實難度是高的。所以我的一對四現在的主述已經算比較，不是比較多是算非常多了。我們的模式是一個學習教練去安排四個人分別的進度。然，盡量將同學科和文科、理科分開。也就是說，以四個人為單位，同年級、同科目的四個人是第一完美，不同年級但同科目的四個人是第二完美。第三個標準是成績，至少要按照這個方向安排。此外，搭配影音課程，可以發現影音課程在我們的體系中是很重要的元素。所以，我認為影音課程透過我現在在教A時，BC珠在看自己的影音課程；我在教B時，AC珠在看自己的影音課程；以此類推的模式，我認為這種方式更加有良心，一對四個人個別指導。當然，Charles你的方式也是和我們四個一起授課，對你來說沒有中間的等待起立。但是明光的部分，基本上是輔導為主，不是真正的教學。所以，我覺得他們的模式會導致學生因為成績不好而轉學。但對明光來說，他們可能認為在教A時，BC珠學習獨立思考和自主學習，而不是發呆。或許能將缺點說成優點。但我的看法是，在教A時，BC珠可能應該在看影帶，才不至於浪費時間。所以，你認為這些看法其實是不可靠的。我其實有三所分校，都是和明光合作的。我們的學生中，大概有一定比例的學生是來自明光，經過明光學習無成效後轉過來的。所以，很多分校的學生來源有20%來自隔壁的明光，有些分校甚至更高，但平均來說是20%。所以關於一對四可能是主流趨勢的部分，還有些什麼要補充的呢？一對四的主流趨勢，當然我可能和Charles你的想法不一樣的原因是因為台北的家長比較能接受數位課程。比較能接受家長和數位課程搭配實體授課，實體的學習教練。對雙北的家長來說，這是他們的優勢，也就是對資訊接受的優勢。如果是這樣，是否像愛學館和愛上學在台北和新北比較能成功？為什麼台北的家長比較能接受數位課程？我的看法是，可能是因為台北的家長對數位認知不排斥，甚至存有對明師這個詞的憧憬。但是他們的接受度很高，甚至有很強的意願。而中南部，甚至桃園以南，明師的影響力就逐漸減弱。在桃園以南，他們比較無法接受明師的數位課程。所以自然而然地，他們願意接受實體老師上課，但並不要求是有名的老師。如果補習班上課的老師都不是明師的話，他們自然而然就覺得誰來教都一樣。也就是說，可能在這方面明師的效果不一樣。桃園以南的國高中社區化比較明顯。由於社區化比較明顯，班級人數就不多，所以找不到超級大明師。台北畢竟是站前，是一個捷運可以到達的地方，可以比較容易集中人數，也因此能夠請到大明師。舉例來說，像宏良數學宏良、詹皓數學詹皓，都是有名的教師。在台北市的南陽街，有名的師資更多。因此，高中生和國中生對大明師的憧憬，其實都還存在。通過觀察，我們補習班的國文科也能夠吸引來自新竹的學生，在週末他們從新竹搭高鐵上來上課。所以可以說，明師的效應在台北仍然存在，並且還沒有衰退的現象。這可能是因為大多數學生可能是因為住在台北而回台北上課，而不是新竹本地人。關於這一點我們無法確定，在討論中可能會得到答案。我覺得這個機會比較高，因為新竹很多家長本身就是台北人，可能從小就在台北上學。至於日本和台灣的市場占有率問題，假設日本佔45%，台灣可能只有2%到3%。我只聽說過最多是3%到4%。你估計10年後，它會呈現怎樣的比例？這個問題是我們討論得最久的。從加速的比例來看，未來可能有機會達到20%。我認為這是一個加速的趨勢。另外，學生量方面，我要先說明為什麼是20%。因為這個市場在個別指導與團班之間的競爭，不僅要搶學生，還要和家教搶學生。在日本，可能沒有那麼強調家教的概念，但在台灣，家教的概念非常強。所以如果不去補團班，我可能請老師到家裡來教學生的比例，在近年有大量提升的情況。我參加了四個家教社團，了解到這一狀況。團班我認為在未來的情況仍然會受到經濟環境下滑的影響。回到剛才的問題，如果個別指導和團班在加速的比例方面，可能是20比80。至於學生量的情況，如果是加速的話，大概是20比80的比例。這是因為這個市場預估經濟環境下滑的情況。我認為這對全國來說是這樣。但在新竹有機會達到4比6，甚至5比5的比例。但我認為這純粹是因為新竹的情況，不會那麼離譜。你問未來10年，我知道。接下來談到營業額，我認為可能佔到3成3比7的比例。因為團班的學生增加不多，但個別指導屬於一個成長趨勢。精英等級那一塊會再往它的消費力看不到頂，所以他們可以往上持續走高。除此之外，在未來，個別指導的品牌都會走的是小而美的模式。因為相較於團班，它的市場腹地需要比較大，所以立案的坪數通常都是70坪以上，甚至可以到100多坪。但是個別指導其實40坪到60坪就是非常非常大的，所以在這種情況下，個別指導的立案其實比較容易。第二個進入門檻比較低的原因是，透過拓人的經驗，我們知道個別指導很重要的參與者經營者，所以素人比如補教大咖、補教老師，可能就那幾百來號的人，但是素人卻有很多，就像螞蟻一樣多，所以他們會是一個大軍。那為什麼20比80的加速仍然存在呢？原因是因為既有的團班撐在那邊，未來十年若要從現在成長到十倍已經是不錯的成果了。\n",
    "\n",
    "再來是第二個原因，即經營者推加某個品牌的多元化關係。例如說愛血管、新櫃、明光、拓人、高明等等現在有好多個別知道的品牌，但真正經營到較大規模的，我認為除了拓人之外，大概只有高明還算不錯。至於吉尚當然也屬於不錯的，但明光的部分我認為會卡住，它每一間分校的瓶頸會卡很久，卡完之後就下來，因為他們的經營模式讓他們上不去，這個連門外漢可能都可以想得到。明光的成本真的很低，因為它的坪數小，且開的地點有些不算最好，而且它的裝潢也低，假設一個五萬的房租，可能一個月賠十一萬，所以它整體一年下來可能賠的不多，但它上去卻很容易有天花板，因為他們的教學模式可能找不到進步的空間，因為我們補習班最重要的來自口碑，而口碑來自於成績的提升，所以成績如果沒有提升，那些服務再到位也是沒有意義的。所以在我看來，明光是氣勢最不OK的，除了明光，我認為愛學館的學習模式未來可能會搞爛補教界的個別指導加盟的貨源。\n",
    "\n",
    "為什麼這樣思考呢？它不是跟你們有相當不同的地方。我在跟他們做研究的時候發現，他們的號召外師做英文其實是噱頭。他們全年度招生線上外師17國語言其實我認為也是噱頭，重點是他們的內容部分，他們其實是用學習王那一套郭音標的數位課程。我要說的是，這個教材並不壞，只是在未來的年代，108課綱之後的教材和以前的教材天差地別。地遠的。我不曉得說，有沒有人真的去看過，因為我是真的買一套回來，家裡看。你說學習王嗎？我聽說學習王是唯一有針對108課綱提早去應變的，而申學王是沒有的。其實我這樣講是他的東西是真的。如果說學生看了他的東西，我只能講說在學校的考試可能真的是不會到你說要到多好。我認為真的有限，是針對國文嗎？我只看國文，所以我在想說會不會是國文，因為國文你的期許跟要求也比較高。這個部分，我認為說要看。畢竟在我看來，國文是唯獨主導其他各科的年代。沒錯，我們在台北看到的狀況是，現在一個國中的斷考試題都已經到四頁五頁，好幾張紙，一次斷考學生寫可能都寫不完。你說這是國文科嗎？不是，這是其他科。未來所有的科目都是採用閱讀素養類型的考題。所以，現在的線上教材，其實我說真的，就我自己在看他們的東西，其實你說他有符合108課綱嗎？\n",
