- The paper discusses the concept of a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that eliminates the need for a financial institution.
- It proposes using a peer-to-peer network with timestamps to prevent double-spending and create an unchangeable record.
- The system suggests using cryptographic proof and a distributed timestamp server to verify transactions.
- A proof-of-work system, similar to Hashcash, is proposed to determine the order of transactions and prevent double-spending.
- The longest chain with the most proof-of-work effort represents the majority decision in the network.
- The storage requirements for the Bitcoin network are discussed, with block headers and Merkle branches being sufficient for simplified payment verification.
- Privacy measures, such as anonymous public keys and new key pairs for each transaction, are mentioned.
- The probability of an attacker catching up with the honest chain decreases exponentially as the number of blocks increases.
- Recipients of new transactions need to wait until the transaction is added to a block and a certain number of blocks have been linked after it to ensure its validity.
- The consensus mechanism in blockchain involves participants voting with their CPU power to validate blocks and reject invalid ones.
