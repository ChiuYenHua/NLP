    """
    Peace means societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups.

"Psychological peace" (such as peaceful thinking and emotions) is less well-defined, yet perhaps a necessary precursor to establishing "behavioural peace". Peaceful behaviour sometimes results from a "peaceful inner disposition". Some[who?] have expressed the belief that peace can be initiated with certain inner qualitiesâ€”such as tranquility, forbearance, respect for others, compassion, self-control, courage, moderation, forgiveness, good temper, caution, and perspectiveâ€”that do not depend upon the uncertainties of daily life.[citation needed] The acquisition of such a peaceful internal disposition for oneself and others can contribute to resolving otherwise seemingly irreconcilable conflicts.

    """
    In ancient times and more recently, peaceful alliances between different nations were codified through royal marriages. Two examples, Hermodike I (c.â€‰800 BCE)[5] and Hermodike II (c.â€‰600 BCE)[6] were Greek princesses from the house of Agamemnon who married kings from what is now Central Turkey. The union of Phrygia / Lydia with Aeolian Greeks resulted in regional peace, which facilitated the transfer of groundbreaking technological skills into Ancient Greece; respectively, the phonetic written script and the minting of coinage (to use a token currency, where the value is guaranteed by the state).[7] Both inventions were rapidly adopted by surrounding nations through further trade and cooperation.
